 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
1.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the following
      servernames will be checked, in this order: *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl,
      *.nl, one of which will match the host-masked server they are
      connecting behind. This will be accepted by the host-masked server it
      is connected behind, but when it reaches the server the host-masked
      server is connected to, the find_server will match, so the host-masked
      server will be dropped.
      --> This corrected?

2.  /MODUNLOAD causes cores:
    - If a module is modified before being unloaded, /MODUNLOAD (and
      therefore /MODRELOAD) may cause a core.

      This problem is caused by the behaviour of the OS, which treats
      shared libraries differently to executables (modifying the ircd
      binary whilst it is running would also cause a core, but is denied
      by the OS).  There is no way to fix this at the application level,
      and fixing the OS to do the right thing is also difficult.

      A workaround to avoid coring is possible however.  To install new
      modules, first remove or rename the old module, then copy/move the
      new file into place.  /MODUNLOAD will then work successfully.

      Alternatively, running ./configure with the --disable-shared-modules
      argument will link all the commands statically, losing the advantages
      of upgrading at runtime, but reducing the chances of accidentally
      coring your server.

3.  Problem with msgfmt command building custom msgs using gettext
    - Please ensure you are using GNU gettext version 0.10.35.
      Other versions are untested, and some are known to be
      incompatible.

4.  Problems with quote set msglocale not working on linux.
    This seems to be a linux problem, /quote set msglocale will sometimes
    get "undone" when a new client connects.  The server will also sometimes
    not correctly set the locale from ircd.conf on startup.

    The solution is if a locale is needed, to have the message_locale="x"
    in ircd.conf, and then rehash to make it take effect.  A rehash after
    startup will also need to be performed to set the locale.

5.  When updating a message file, in certain unknown situations it will core
    if the file in use is being accessed.  To prevent this from happening,
    use '/quote SET MSGLOCALE standard' BEFORE issuing make install.  When
    the file is installed, you can SET MSGLOCALE back to the language that
    was just updated.

6.  IAuthd is broken beyond belief.  It does not work at this time.  If this
    bothers you, fix it for us.

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug in by E-MAIL to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org.

 Please include a gdb backtrace and a copy of your config.h and ircd.conf
 with any report  (with passwords and other sensitive information masked).
