-*- How to use ircd-hybrid's CVS system.

--- Open branches:
--- HEAD version: 7.1 (CURRENT)
--- HYBRID_7_0 version: 7.0 (RELEASE, STABLE)
--- Closed branches:
--- (none at this time)

I'll be your CVS maven, of sorts.  Here's what you need to know to use things
efficiently.  First off, some ground rules:

	1) Don't commit to a release branch without explicit approval (and
	   NEED) unless it has been to the HEAD branch first.
	2) Don't break the HEAD branch just because you can.  You should do
	   your best to keep it working and in top shape, but new features
	   and code refactoring are welcome.
	3) If you're unsure of a bit of code, get review from at least one
	   other member of the team.  You really should have tested other
	   changes adequately, and know their impact.  Don't continually
	   commit third-rate or work-in-progress code.
	4) If you are doing code reworking/refactoring don't commit it
	   while it is incomplete.

OK, so here's the idea, we have a HEAD branch which is the CURRENT branch,
and we have one or more HYBRID_<major>_<minor> branches open at a time.  That
is, as mentioned above, open for new features and general work.  There is one
STABLE branch open, where new features and fixes go after a certain period of
time in the CURRENT branch.  We also have a RELEASE branch (which may be the
STABLE branch) where release versions of the ircd will be taken off.  They will
be tagged at release time with a tag in the format of
HYBRID_<major>_<minor>_RELEASE.  That tag will not be a branch, and will not
be open for commits.  Release candidates should be made off the RELEASE branch,
and bug fixes should go to CURRENT and then STABLE, as per normal procedure, if
those branches are affected, and then into the RELEASE branch once it has been
tested.

An aside, worth mentioning in the context of releases, you should generate a
ChangeLog as part of a release tarball, using a tool such as cvs2cl, but it
should not be put into the CVS branch, as this can lead to confusion.

To check out a branch:
	cvs co -r<branch> <module>
To check out HEAD:
	cvs co <module>

Any more advanced operations, talk to myself, or our release engineer.

Note that this document and the list of branches at the top of this file
should be kept up to date on all open branches.

And finally, if you frequently don't follow our procedures, it may be too much
of a churn on the repository and release cycle for you to remain commit access
unfiltered.  You may be required to work with a specific mentor on the team or
send all diffs to the mailing list before every commit for a period of time to
be determined based on the results of your actions, and efforts to be careful
when committing in the future.

Happy hacking!
