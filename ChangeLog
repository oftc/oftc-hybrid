	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- init_ip_hash_table() was a better name than clear_ip_hash_table() 
	- removed typedef for IPHASH (obsfuscation) 
	- redid memory allocation to use block heap 
	- changed > to >= for comparision to throttle time, it was possible
	  for a compare to fail and leave 0 count ip_entry(s) in the hash.  
	- N.B. subtle bug fixed by this commit.. When the ip hash table was
	  purely used to count number of clients on an IP, there could never
	  be more than MAXCONNECTIONS ip_entry(s), Once ip throttling was
	  added, it is possible to have ip_entry(s) in use that have 0 clients
	  on them, i.e. they are "remembering" an ip was recently used. This
	  means it was possible (though unlikely) for all ip_entry(s) to be
	  used thus panic'ing the server.  This could affect a smaller server
	more easily.

2003-02-02 22:08  db

	* src/: client.c, send.c: 
	- oops. the move of the SetDead() in client.c exit_client() 
	  was the real culprit of the double send of ERROR followed by the
	  QUIT old code (from hybrid-6 as well btw) set client dead before
	  sending message to channel about QUIT, hence client never saw the
	double message.

2003-02-02 13:45  db

	* src/send.c:

	* modules/core/m_kick.c:

2003-02-01 13:11  db

	- While I agree with andrews ideas and he did a good job of finding 
	  this one, the fix to m_kick.c was a little extreme. I think this 
	  should take care of it.  
	  I've added a temporary IsExited() flag. We really don't need it
	  but for debugging it could be handy.

	* src/channel.c, modules/core/m_kick.c, modules/core/m_part.c,
	include/channel.h: 
	- Move part_one_client to channel.c 
	- Convert kicks of yourself to parts. This is the simplest way to
	  stop big problems if a user kicks themselves and then exits during
	  the kick.  Users should be using PART anyway to leave the channel,
	  so this has a nice side-effect of sending the right message. If it
	  is discovered that this is breaking clients it may need to be
	redesigned.  

2003-01-31 05:53  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c, modules/core/m_part.c, include/channel.h: 
	- Kludge around the fact that a channel can be destroyed after 
	  remove_user_from_channel is called, by incrementing users 
	  artificially, and calling sub1_from_channel manually later.  
	  - This would be less of a kludge if we rename users to 
	    refcount or something(TODO).  
	- In order not to break vchans, I had to set the vchan ID when the
	  users count is 2 or less, instead of the normal 1. This is an awful
	  kludge, and we need a better way to do it.

	  - A client is closing after exit_client() has started.  
	  - A client is dead only after exit_client() has completed.  
	  - Before changing any lists, you must check if a client is dead.  
	  - Only exit_client() should ever SetDead() or SetClosing().

	* modules/m_invite.c: 
	- bah. This is tricky to get right. but you cannot "broadcast" an
	  invite to hybrid-6 (presumbably csircd etc.) servers without them
	  getting upset about ghosted nick. oops. We reviewed and reviewed and
	  tested... but anyway. So, use CAP_PARA to not send the broadcast to
	  non CAP_PARA servers.  Note, the only easy clean way of not ending
	  up with a double invite notice to a target, is to paramertise the
	  INVITE notice. INVITE notice now has four parameters if its just a
	  notice of an invite. The normal three parameters is used in all
	  other cases. So, in cases of -p, only the three parameter version is
	used.

	- trivial change to remove a duplicate #include "client.h" 

2003-01-08 23:15  db

	* RELNOTES, include/client.h, src/channel.c, src/channel_mode.c,
	src/client.c, src/ircdauth.c, src/packet.c, src/parse.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c, src/send.c: 
	- rationalised the exit_client code.  
	  IsClosing() is used to keep clients from being added to the
	  abort_list twice IsDead() is now used to keep clients from being
	  added to the dead_list twice IsDefunct() is used to check whether a
	  client is dying ie.  IsClosing() || IsDead() 
	  exit_client() is no longer called in some cases if a client/server 
	  is already IsDefunct().  
	  This removes the possibility of a double free of a client and
	  removes the possibility of accessing memory after it has been
	freed.  
	- Also removed a "bare" access to FLAGS_IPHASH 

2002-12-29 14:42  gregp

	* contrib/challenge.irc: 
	- ahem, actually add challenge.irc 

2002-12-29 14:42  gregp

	* tools/rsa_respond/respond.c: 
	- added challenge.irc to contrib/, compliments of BlackJac@EFNet 
	  script for EPIC (and apparently BitchX too) to support opering via
	  /challenge 
	- cosmetic change in respond.c, don't append a \n to stuff we puts() 

2002-12-28 00:02  bill

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- removed duplicated DupString() call, pointed out by Michael W.

	* Hybrid-team: 
	- Jack Low. so there.  

2002-12-18 20:51  db

	* Hybrid-team, RELNOTES, src/channel_mode.c: 
	- fixed a very nasty buffer overflow in ban handling.  
	  ban strings cannot be longer than MODEBUFLEN (200 chars) 
	  this fix to channel_mode.c ensures this happens.  
	- updated RELNOTES to note this change 
	- added MetalRock to the team listing, he's done more than a lot of 
	  folk at helping us find bugs.  

2002-12-18 10:03  bill

	* RELNOTES: 
	- finished updating RELNOTES in preparation for rc6 

2002-12-17 22:33  db

	* contrib/m_tburst.c: 
	- committed metalrocks change 

2002-12-17 21:44  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- removed a redundant free_client(), this was placed just before 
	  exit_one_client() which caused localClient part to go to NULL.  
	  This confused MyConnect() etc. so clients were not being removed 
	  from channel lists properly. The free_client() call is being
	  called after exit_client() anyway.  
	- tidied up a bit the formatting in one place...  

2002-12-17 05:35  androsyn

	* adns/parse.c: Allow '_' in hostnames per rfc1033 recommendations 

2002-12-16 15:43  db

	* src/packet.c: 
	- I have a sneaking suspicion the file descriptor is still on the 
	  poll/select etc. list... this should be dug into further.. In any
	  case its better to be a bit defensive about poking at a client
	anyway.  

2002-12-16 13:53  db

	* src/packet.c: 
	- localClient can go NULL after a parse here as well.  

2002-12-16 00:18  db

	* RELNOTES, src/kdparse.c: 
	- cleaned up getfield() field code. I obviously did it in a hurry
	  last time.  this fixes bug with , in a reason field.  
	- updated RELNOTES again

2002-12-15 23:30  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- add some sanity tests to not try to use who->user if user is NULL 

2002-12-15 22:00  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- Don't decrement the joined count unless actually succeeded in
	  removing a channel join! 

2002-12-15 16:50  db

	* doc/technical/send.txt, modules/m_invite.c, src/packet.c: 
	- updated the send docs. a couple of functions disapeared to be
	  replaced with one function in its place. oops.  
	- a client can have a localClient part of NULL when we go try to
	  read from it oops. We can't do that. Notably this happened when a
	  server was unauthed, coring the server.  
	- m_invite was not sending invites properly when +p was on. I admit 
	  this code could be finessed, but I wanted to get it working first.  

2002-12-14 00:37  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- be careful with IsCapable() when the state of localClient is not
	  known if its NULL, it will panic the server.  

2002-12-13 21:08  db

	* src/channel_mode.c: 
	- allow "op cookies" *ugh* 
	  mode * +o-b nick cookie will now work. its an exception for this 
	  case only. ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh 
	- cleaned up some of the table code. Mode table of 512 is a tad
	  large but will fix later...

2002-12-12 20:21  db

	* src/packet.c: 
	- *sigh* a client can be set dead (IsDead()) in a number of places 
	  while parsing. In all cases, if exit_client() is called, 
	  and the client is local (which it is here) then localClient goes
	  *poof* and its set dead. You can't read data from something that
	  aint there scotty! SHE'S GONNA BLOW CAPTAIN!

	* Hybrid-team: Submitted by:	vx0 
	- updated vx0's email address, per his request 

2002-12-11 23:33  db

	* src/: client.c, packet.c: 
	- client can be SetDead() after parsing a message, if this happens 
	  don't try to parse any outstanding buffers for it! 

2002-12-10 14:29  bill

	* src/client.c: 
	- fixed missing ) 

2002-12-09 20:10  androsyn

	* src/client.c: This is the correct fix for the linebuf leak. 
	Basically close_connection() wasn't setting MyConnect() == FALSE as
	doing so would have caused a core dump further down.  More the
	close_connection() call towards the end of the function where
	localClient is no longer needed.  Add a free_local_client() function
	that actually does the free and sets localClient = NULL 

2002-12-03 19:42  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in,
	src/dynlink.c: Use dlfunc(3) if we have it, fake it otherwise, at
	least abstracting out the hideousness of data pointer integral
	casts.  

2002-11-30 06:39  androsyn

	* src/client.c: 
	  Fixed the leaking linebuf issue.  Basically what would happen is
	  that upon exit_one_client() we never called linebuf_donebuf for
	  the clients sendq and recvq..oops.  

2002-11-28 10:36  db

	* src/channel.c:

	- grrrr KNOCKDISABLED needs to use 715 (thank you Michael) 

2002-11-26 20:56  jmallett

	* src/Makefile.in: Take the easy way out for non-GNU compilers, and
	make people make sure tools.c always compiles with whatever changes
	they're making - roll-back revision 7.113's unexplained delta here,
	and compile it always.  If we really do care enough to rip it out of
	the build where it isn't needed, there are other ways to do that,
	like we do for @SPRINTF@.  

2002-11-26 20:46  jmallett

	* src/: s_bsd_devpoll.c, s_bsd_kqueue.c, s_bsd_poll.c,
	s_bsd_select.c, s_bsd_sigio.c: Fix compilation (mostly) with TenDRA
	4.1.2 on FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT, by not letting unused s_bsd_*.c become
	empty compilation units.  

2002-11-26 13:34  db

	* servlink/servlink.h, src/md5.c: Repeat after me "char isn't
	signed"...  "on reasonable UNIX systems".  Checking for
	"<derived-char> > -1" is broken, when you mean "<derived-char> != 
	(char) -1" [~0, 0xff on most machines].  
	
	That table is all-but begging to be int8_t or similar.  
	
	Also, match the constness returned by the _cfp functions, since
	discarding it is evil, and we don't seem to need to.  

2002-11-23 10:12  db

	* contrib/m_operspy.c: 
	- fix a potential core. this does create a detection vulnerability,

	It seems to be that there exist a problem with the dynamic core
	modules, afaik it  should be  impossible to unload a  core  module,

	* modules/: m_motd.c, m_stats.c: Submitted by:	Lee H

	  oper requests is in fact correct, at the msgtab level.  each mo_()

	* contrib/m_force.c, modules/core/m_server.c, src/channel.c,
	src/client.c, src/linebuf.c: 
	- as noted by adx. There were a few unnecessary checks for NULL
	  pointer as we already have called outofmemory(), its pointless.  
	  adx also spotted an unfreed server struct.  

2002-10-08 14:06  db

	* modules/m_motd.c: 
	    With hide_servers=yes and disable_remote=no, the servername is
	    removed from the 312 numeric when you /whois nick, but you can
	just do /motd nick and see the server they are on. This patch fixes

	  the event_table[]. Range checking was not being done. <g> 

2002-09-19 09:14  bill

	* INSTALL, contrib/m_opme.c, modules/m_connect.c: 
	- added fbsd note to ipv6 install notes

	* modules/: m_kline.c, m_testline.c:

2002-09-11 08:27  db

	* RELNOTES, include/hostmask.h, src/client.c, src/hostmask.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- tiny fix to speed up kline processing slightly. Instead of
	  checking for I lines as well as klines from find_kill(), only check
	  for klines. This adds find_kline_conf() to hostmask.c, I also
	  changed find_dline() to find_dline_conf() for consistency.  Noted by
	Lee Hardy (The goat man) 

2002-09-10 19:24  db

2002-09-10 12:58  db

	* modules/: m_oper.c, core/m_nick.c: 
	- This is the better fix for the ~ nick bug. Look at
	  clean_nick_name() in hybrid-6 this fix duplicates the behaviour of
	hybrid-6 clean_nick_name better.  

2002-09-10 11:50  androsyn

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: Fix another NULL nick bug that Lee found 

2002-09-09 19:25  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- conf->status not conf->flags for CONF_ILLEGAL 

2002-09-09 06:43  db

	* src/: ircd_parser.y, s_conf.c, s_log.c: 
	- having ircd_parser.y put a string into ->host, then having s_conf
	  immediately moving it from host to name,just seemed too silly for
	  me. (conf_add_x_conf) Also cleaned up some style.  

2002-09-09 06:32  db

	* modules/m_oper.c: 
	- fixed typo umodes not umode 

2002-09-08 20:05  db

	* modules/m_oper.c: 
	- source_p->umode not source_p->flags, not that it seems to matter.  
	  tbh, I don't think ms_oper() is ever ever called.  

2002-09-08 14:09  bill

	* contrib/m_operspy.c: 
	- fixed non-oper-issued to properly respond with Unknown command 
	  side note: there should be a way for a msgtab-triggered function
	  to access the command that triggered it 

2002-09-06 23:34  androsyn

	* src/channel.c: This needs to be TOPICLEN+1, otherwise we'll chop
	the last byte off.  We already allocate TOPICLEN+1 so..  

2002-09-06 19:18  db

	* RELNOTES: 
	- updated release notes with bugs fixed since last release 

2002-09-06 12:37  db

	* include/s_log.h, modules/m_challenge.c, modules/m_oper.c,
	src/s_log.c, src/send.c: 
	- fixed bug with operlog and foperlog handling. The ConfigFile
	  entries were being treated as char filename pointers, instead of
	  strings.  There was missing log_failed_oper() code.  
	  log_oper() code was not being called when it should have been.  

2002-09-05 08:07  db

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- fixed /whois * bug. minor bug, but technically wrong. when doing a
	  /whois * it missed the fact it was successful, and promptly whinged
	  about there being no user *.  

2002-09-05 07:06  db

	* src/: Makefile.in, channel.c, class.c, client.c, s_conf.c,
	send.c: 
	- convert these to use DLINK_FOREACH DLINK_FOREACH_SAFE 

2002-09-04 23:05  db

	* modules/: m_accept.c, m_close.c, m_knock.c, m_who.c, m_whois.c: 
	- converted a pile of for() to DLINK_NEXT 
	- cleaned up m_who (idea from Androsyn) 

2002-09-04 19:48  db

	* modules/m_gline.c, src/s_gline.c: 
	- If a local oper votes twice on a gline, don't 
	  do the send-realops, don't send it off of the server, just notice
	  the oper and continue.  

2002-09-04 18:30  db

	* include/s_stats.h, src/s_stats.c: 
	- removed another never used statistic. It wasn't used in hybrid-6
	either <g> 

2002-09-04 18:10  db

	* include/s_stats.h, modules/m_stats.c, modules/m_trace.c,
	src/s_gline.c, src/s_stats.c: 
	- removed statistics variables never ever used (udp and local
	  client) Early versions of hybrid (based on irc2.8) had udp ping port
	  which was removed.  This is obviously no longer needed.  
	- re-worked m_stats to separate stats g from stats G, pending glines
	  vs. placed glines also reworked the style. Its a PITA fixing the
	style, but ever so much easier for editing...  
	- cleaned up style in m_trace.c also started introducing
	  DLINK_FOREACH. It does not change the code at all, its just a macro.
	No point doing it all at once.  

2002-09-03 14:30  db

	* contrib/m_whois.c: 
	- As pointed out by Lee, fix server hide 

2002-09-03 10:15  db

	* src/channel_mode.c: 
	- allow more than four "simple modes" i.e. +isntp but allow only 
	  one per. i.e. only one +i is allowed, only one -p etc. this
	  matches behaviour of hybrid-6 

2002-09-03 07:44  bill

	* contrib/m_operspy.c: 
	- final cleanups 
	- added warning for use 
	- changed copyright to primarily me, so that no one else gets blamed
	for this thing =) 

2002-09-03 07:27  bill

	* contrib/m_operspy.c: 
	- fixed compiletime warnings 

2002-09-03 04:24  db

	* src/messages.tab: 
	- missing ':' (I thought I fixed this already...) 

2002-09-02 22:43  bill

	* contrib/: Makefile.in, m_operspy.c: 
	- added a neat little toy that I made tonight.  extreme caution
	  should be exercised when using this module.  
	- modified Makefile to compile operspy automatically 

2002-09-01 23:34  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- ircnet spells it "unauthorized" so I guess we should too.  

2002-09-01 23:06  db

	* contrib/m_whois.c: 
	- fixed stupid bug in contrib m_whois.c 
	  check entire if() for MyConnect() first, this means the glob flag 
	  is useless. cleaned up.  

2002-09-01 22:34  db

	* contrib/README, modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_join.c,
	src/channel_mode.c, src/s_auth.c: 
	- strengthened warning in README in contrib 
	- cleaned up logic in m_join.c to be somewhat saner 
	- burst proper channel modes in m_join for persistent channels 
	- removed superflous MODE when the SJOIN can do it anyway 
	- chm_simple() was missing mode_limit check, thus allowing clients 
	  to core the server with a pile of +nt-nt+nt etc.  
	- commented s_auth.c madness better 
	- corrected style in s_auth.c 

2002-08-28 11:13  db

	* src/channel_mode.c: 
	- committed fix as spotted by lee hardy, I also commented a function 
	  to make it clear 

2002-08-28 10:00  androsyn

	* doc/README.cidr_bans, include/irc_string.h, src/channel.c,
	src/match.c: Add CIDR bans.  This does both ipv4 and ipv6 cidr bans 

2002-08-25 09:21  androsyn

	* adns/query.c: 
	  Fix a stupid bug that could have potentially overflowed the heap. 
	  This never could have happened though, because the zone we are
	  checking is always ip6.int.  

2002-08-24 21:30  lusky

	* doc/example.efnet.conf: 
	- corrected disclaimer in example.efnet.com to per Disciple's rant 

2002-08-24 21:19  lusky

	* src/client.c: 
	- client IPs on exits were always masked (fl) 

2002-08-22 20:30  db

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- m_whois was also wrong.  
	  same reasons as m_nick.  

2002-08-22 19:26  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c, src/parse.c: 
	- the parse fix is incorrect. really that entire parser needs to be 
	  torn apart and re-thought/re-written. *sigh* the protocol
	  apparently =relies= upon empty parv[1] in some cases! we cannot
	  simply blast it away as the original fix did. m_nick now checks
	  using BadPtr that parv[1] is not NULL or parv[1][0] != '\0' .  
	  I bet there are other functions that should do the same thing.
	  *ugh* 

2002-08-22 16:08  db

	* src/tools.c: 
	- I typoed it here too 

2002-08-22 16:06  db

	* include/tools.h: typoed -> as _ 

2002-08-22 14:33  db

	correct a bug in dlinkmove 

2002-08-22 09:08  db

	  reported by Justin Hammond 

2002-08-21 19:01  lusky

	* src/parse.c: 
	- check for null arg after :

2002-08-19 22:49  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/client.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- ip_hash() has to know whether its IPV4 or IPV6 form of ip 
	  so this has to be passed all the way down.  

2002-08-19 18:32  db

	* contrib/m_whois.c, include/numeric.h: 
	- included RPL_WHOISACTUALLY in numeric.h

2002-08-19 18:02  db

	* include/patchlevel.h, src/channel_mode.c, src/messages.tab: 
	- added 338 to messages.tab 
	- add some buffer overflow checks to channel_mode.c

	* src/s_conf.c: A slightly less retarded version of hash_ip() 

2002-08-18 23:06  db

2002-08-18 22:23  db

	* contrib/: Makefile.in, README, m_whois.c: Added Gozems m_whois.c
	to contrib. It looks better than ours, but we have to wait until
	more testing is done before making it the official m_whois, so it
	will have to wait until 7.1 

2002-08-17 00:16  a1kmm

	* doc/example.efnet.conf: 
	- bunch of fallacies in this document corrected.  
	
	  NUMBER one, a reconnect time of five minutes on efnet WILL cause 
	  nick collides.  
	  NUMBER two, a longer ping time is not a help for a client or
	  server as it means more possibility for ghosting etc.  
	  NUMBER three, a vchan cannot possibly cause any problem at all on
	  efnet except look "weird" to the rest of the network.

	* modules/m_info.c:

	  error.  
	- m_trace.c I simply tidied up the prototype, no need to split it
	into two lines.  

2002-07-06 15:25  lusky

	- revved patchlevel to beta18

2002-07-06 09:58  db

	* modules/m_kline.c, src/hostmask.c, src/kdparse.c: 
	- This fixes non-redundant dlines for IPV4 at least. The IPV6 dline
	  code is still incomplete. I also fixed a number of style problems.  

2002-07-06 07:03  leeh

	* src/vchannel.c: 
	- we dont put ;'s on the end of if()s ;p

2002-07-04 09:07  db

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: 
	- there is no way we are going to find a client struct we just
	  created on the unknowns list! 

2002-07-04 09:07  androsyn

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: The second half of that goofy spaces in
	SJOIN bug..  

2002-07-04 06:32  androsyn

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: If the length of a servername goes over
	hostlen, it surely is bogus.  

2002-07-04 06:13  androsyn

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: This seems to fix the jupe issue..  

2002-07-03 08:03  leeh

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- fixed an issue with invisible users being shown in a /who output.  
	  this whole code needs a rewrite, but.  

2002-07-03 05:31  leeh

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- retard proofing, it seems the concept of actually specifying a
	  param in --with-maxclients is beyond some people.  

2002-07-02 16:58  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- fixed off by one error in too many recipients code in m_message.c 

2002-07-02 16:24  db

	- fixed stupid bug I introduced with @# oops 

2002-07-02 15:25  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- fix redundant nick/message handling. duplicate nicks/messages
	  should simply be ignored. i.e. /msg #channel,#channel hi 
	  results in "hi" to #channel 
	- fix so it properly reports too many targets.  

2002-06-28 21:34  db

	* include/client.h, modules/m_trace.c, modules/core/m_message.c,
	src/client.c: 
	- in fixing m_privmsg.c I noticed a function it used was only used
	  by m_privmsg.c moved it from client.c into m_privmsg.c (I bad, I
	  couldn't help it) I also noticed a function used in m_trace.c only
	  used in m_trace.c, so moved that as well.  

2002-06-28 11:48  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- fixed other style problems, removed unnecessary casts 

2002-06-28 11:18  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c, src/client.c, src/messages.tab:

	  actual number of recipients actually processed.  
	- Fixed a few style problems, and removed unnecessary casts 

2002-06-27 08:16  leeh

	* include/config.h, src/client.c: 
	- well fix the QS stuff in 7.1 (agreed with andro) 

2002-06-26 19:14  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Got the logic on that assert() backwards..how
	embarrassing 

2002-06-26 17:01  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Those should be source_p not client_p 

2002-06-26 16:38  leeh

	* modules/: m_kline.c, m_unkline.c: 
	- synced these up to show the same 

2002-06-26 15:01  androsyn

	* include/config.h, src/client.c: Minor little changes regarding
	the value that we should use for pending remote exits 

2002-06-26 14:35  leeh

	* src/client.c: 
	- exit 15000 clients at once if compiled for efnut.  

2002-06-26 14:16  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Fixed the issue with quit storms making the server
	completely unresponsive.  Basically what we do now is, add the
	clients that need exited to a linked list then have an event that
	will exit them 1500 at a time, rather than trying to exit say, 50000
	clients at once.  

2002-06-26 07:20  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Add some assert()'s to exit_client() and changed
	the error message for abort_list clients from "Dead link" to "Write
	error: connection closed" 

2002-06-26 05:16  leeh

	* modules/m_unkline.c: 
	- consistency with hyb6 and /kline, only use sptr->name in the
	  notice, not n!u@h{o} 

2002-06-25 20:05  androsyn

	* include/ircd.h, include/s_log.h, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_signal.c,
	src/s_conf.c, src/s_log.c: Make ircd.log close and open itself on
	rehash or SIGHUP.  Also clean up some formatting 

2002-06-25 16:06  leeh

	* doc/: example.conf, index.txt: 
	- doc updates 

2002-06-24 15:06  leeh

	- the juped channel notices wandered off.  

2002-06-24 11:12  leeh

	- exit the server that introduced the existing server to us always.  

2002-06-23 21:28  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- pure consistency in naming. use local_server_p to keep it obvious.  

2002-06-23 16:02  leeh

	* src/send.c: 
	- removed a spurious IsClosing() that broke sending error messages
	  et al to the client.  

2002-06-23 02:22  leeh

	* help/opers/rehash: 
	- there is no rehash help (Hwy) 

2002-06-22 15:39  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- same bug was in add_lazylinkchannel() grrr 

2002-06-22 14:23  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- duh. make the comments agree with the arguments to the function.  

2002-06-22 13:27  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- add_lazylinkclient had the wrong assert. Its not a client in the 
	  first arg, it should always be a locally connected leaf server.  
	  Changed comments and parm names to make this clear, changed bogus
	  assert.  

2002-06-20 19:33  lusky

	* include/patchlevel.h: 
	- revved patchlevel to beta17 

2002-06-20 11:00  leeh

	- dont allow spoof notices if HIDE_SPOOF_IPS.  

2002-06-19 13:49  leeh

	- audited the IP stuff in relation to spoofing and /trace 

2002-06-19 13:39  leeh

	* RELNOTES, modules/m_trace.c, src/parse.c: 
	- updated RELNOTES 
	- dont show an IP in /trace if HIDE_SPOOF_IPS.  

2002-06-19 13:26  leeh

	* src/client.c: 
	- I think ive got this right, hide the IP for servers always if
	  defined hide it for spoofs only if SHOW_IP (HIDE_IP would give the
	spoofed host) 

2002-06-19 13:17  leeh

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, src/client.c: 
	- I think I was on craq when I did the HIDE_SERVERS_IPS define. 
	fixed it.  
	- added HIDE_SPOOF_IPS, for efnut.  
	- fixed the dead link/sendq notice for servers

2002-06-16 19:57  db

	* src/s_bsd_devpoll.c: -missing include (reported by Wendy) 

2002-06-16 19:54  db

	* include/tools.h: in tools.h we had: m->next = NULL; m->next =
	list->head; 
	
	That was daft. (spotted by Lee, but we forgot to fix earlier) 
	removing the redundant assign might speed things up slightly.  

2002-06-16 10:23  db

	* src/balloc.c: 
	- fixed a number of style problems. We want function names to begin 
	  at first char.  
	  we want to be consistent with if (foo) { oneline; } etc.  
	  and we want to be consistent with return needing () or not.  
	- fixed bug with elemsize causing odd address SIGBUS failures esp.
	on solaris.  

2002-06-16 09:31  leeh

	* modules/.cvsignore, modules/.depend, modules/Makefile.in,
	src/.depend, src/Makefile.in: 
	- patch via hwy: 
	  Id is not needed in .depends, when you lose the dependency files
	  (from that .cvsignore) you'll have problems recreating them.  

2002-06-16 07:55  leeh

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- from hwy: 
	  The enclosed patch fixes the detection of nanosleep(), when it's 
	  non-existant, it'll actually enable select for the delay loop.  

2002-06-15 16:07  leeh

	* include/config.h:

	looking things.  

2002-06-14 12:38  leeh

2002-06-14 10:19  leeh

	* include/channel_mode.h, src/channel_mode.c: 
	- adxs patch to fix +a and numerous channel_mode.c bugs 
	
	  as far as im aware, this fixes all of the problems with +a, but we
	  need more testing.  

2002-06-12 12:29  db

	* src/: ircd_parser.y, s_conf.c: 
	- moved yy_aconf back into ircd-parser.y, its not needed in s_conf.c

	  into four lists, those to check every minute, hour, day, week -
	  which should make them more efficient and help to cope with the
	  demand for longer tklines.  

2002-06-08 17:22  androsyn

	* src/client.c: We shouldn't call  remove_dependents if
	source_p->serv == NULL, why source_p->serv == NULL i'm not sure 

2002-06-07 16:38  leeh

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- move the sendto_realops_flags() down till after the server is made 
	  so the IO doesnt trigger an exit for a server that doesnt have a 
	  cptr->serv yet.  

2002-06-07 16:37  androsyn

	* README.FIRST, README.PLATFORMS, RELNOTES, modules/m_stats.c,
	src/s_serv.c: Fix for GCC on SPARC compiling in 32-bit mode.  The
	solution is to not let GCC move things from the structure pointers
	in to a register, it apparently is too broken to figure out how to
	do this properly.  Instead, memcpy the structure to a local one on
	the stack, and use it.  
	
	The GCC people were given a bug report on this and did nothing. 
	Considering the popularity of the SPARC platform, some shame should
	go around that a lowly IRCD coder had to spend some months trying to
	work around this, and that despite a bug report, the GCC people
	did/said nothing.  
	
	Anyway, this now makes ircd-hybrid-7 work on SPARC systems with GCC.
	Great!

	Approved by db 
	
	The patch does the following: 
	- fixes persistent channels to actually persist, we fixed them too
	far and broke them 
	- removes the perm crap from persistent channels.  we should always 
	persist, no matter whether a user parts, quits or falls down a
	rabbit hole into wonderland 
	- adds ircd-hybrid-7b14 stuff to RELNOTES 
	- adds docs about the $$ and $# stuff to whats-new, as well as
	updates 
	- adds the CHARSET=rfc1459 to 005 
	
	Theres still issues with persistent channels, but im too tired atm
	to do anything.  Basically - the event system/cleanup_channels()
	doesnt cope with the fact a channel should persist for at least
	persist_time.  It uses the TS of the channel - so if a user parts a
	1 year old channel, itll persist.  If the cleanup_channels() event
	is called 10s later, itll be destroyed in that event - we need to
	add a chptr->ts_persist to mark when we started persisting, and use
	that instead of TS in cleanup_channels().

	* include/channel.h, modules/core/m_mode.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c,
	src/channel.c, src/channel_mode.c: Lee's patch..here is the
	description he gave: 
	
	The following patch adds back support for bouncing modes from
	clients we deop on an SJOIN.  
	
	Basically - when we bounce a clients status (either halfop or
	chanop) we add a user to a chptr->deopped LL.  Whenever we receive a
	mode, we search this list for the client, ignoring it if theyre
	found.  
	
	Whenever we change a clients membership on a channel (from anything,
	to anything), we scan the deopped list, removing them if theyre
	there.  

2002-04-05 09:08  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- we were removing client from history too late. This meant that a 
	  nick chase kill could cause a double exit of a client. oops.

	* src/send.c: Wohali's patch for that double free bug.  She's
	certainly got more patience than I do :P 

2002-03-12 21:16  androsyn

	using select()

2002-03-09 16:14  androsyn

	* include/s_serv.h, src/s_serv.c: Okay..so I was a little
	aggressive with that last one.  

2002-03-09 16:01  androsyn

	* include/s_serv.h, src/s_serv.c: Changed a few more functions from
	globals to static 

2002-03-09 14:59  androsyn

	* src/send.c: Remove debug.h from send.c 

2002-03-09 14:57  androsyn

	* src/: .depend, Makefile.in, m_error.c, send.c: Removed debug.c
	completely.  It was only being used three times so, we just replace
	it with ilog()

	src/s_conf.c, src/s_log.c, src/scache.c, src/sprintf_irc.c: Clean
	up a lot of dead code.  Also made a number of functions that were 
	declared global as locals, as they were only used within their own
	object file.  

2002-03-09 13:57  androsyn

	* src/channel_mode.c: Make ModeTable static as it is only used in
	channel_mode.c 

2002-03-09 10:03  androsyn

	* include/fileio.h, src/fileio.c: file_open / file_close can be
	static now, as they only get called in fileio.c 

2002-03-08 17:03  leeh

	* contrib/m_force.c: 
	- added the forcejoin/forcepart module ive been using to develop irc
	bncs

	these days.  

2002-03-05 21:41  lusky

	* RELNOTES, include/patchlevel.h: 
	- revved patchlevel to 7beta12 
	- rearranged release notes 

2002-03-04 15:45  androsyn

	* src/send.c: Fixed the stupid bug in sendto_list_remote that cause
	us to send certain messages back to the sender.  

2002-03-04 14:29  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c: 
	- patch by adx <nizynski@optimus.waw.pl> to correctly add a +ov user
	  to &chptr->chanops_voiced 
	- make sure for +ov users we send +v as well as +o.. this is icky
	  though, as we have to recheck MAXMODEPARAMS..

	* src/: adns.c, channel.c, client.c, ircd.c, ircd_parser.y,
	s_auth.c, s_log.c: Changed a bunch of eventAdd()'s to
	eventAddIsh().  I think it is a bad idea to have 15 events all
	coming up at the same time.  This will stagger the events a bit.  

2002-03-01 09:03  jmallett

	* README.FIRST, RELNOTES: Combine the notices for people who don't
	read documentation.  In reality, if someone can't be bothered
	reading documentation, should we really document this _twice_ on
	their account?  Sooth, if they aren't reading README.FIRST, I don't
	think they'll read RELNOTES.  The former has a name that yells out
	to be read, the latter is just something people with good sense will
	read.  
	
	In short, I've combined the notices into README.FIRST, using the
	(IMO) much nicer formatting from RELNOTES.

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/setup.h.in: Here are some better autoconf checks for
	nanosleep() 

2002-03-01 07:30  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in, src/ircd.c: 
	Add a check for nanosleep(). If nanosleep() isn't found we fall back
	to using select() for the delay.  The main reason for this is the
	fact that usleep() tends to be implemented via SIGALRM.  

2002-03-01 01:52  jmallett

	* README.PLATFORMS: Add notation for broken platforms, and mark
	GCC/SPARC ones as broken, until I see otherwise.  

2002-03-01 01:40  jmallett

	* README.FIRST: Back out my previous change.  Further [read:
	Proper] testing for the bug here shows it does in fact exist. 
	Apologies for the misinformation.  The test case was not as simple
	as I remembered it to be.  

2002-03-01 00:41  jmallett

	* README.FIRST: NetBSD's compiler team doesn't suck;  Their version
	of egcs doesn't break on SPARC, unlike newer GCC on OpenBSD and
	Solaris.  

2002-03-01 00:09  jmallett

	* adns/event.c, src/s_auth.c: Oops, bad juli! 
	
	Committing for standards reasons after being up for far too long is
	a bad idea.  Inserting inappropriate casts is worse.  
	
	Change some idiocy I did involving use of size_t instead of
	socklen_t.  
	
	And as an aside, I mixed up my ranting about signed vs. unsigned in
	my last commit.  

2002-02-28 12:36  ejb

	* include/patchlevel.h: 
	- added release names! 

2002-02-28 09:14  wcampbel

	* README.PLATFORMS, help/users/notice, help/users/privmsg: Cleaned
	up some formatting in README.PLATFORMS Non-opers cannot use
	  username%hostname@server, so don't include it in the help files 

2002-02-28 09:12  leeh

	* INSTALL, RELNOTES, doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- added a b12 specific section in RELNOTES, noting the recent config
	  change I did, also moved the convertklines stuff into there.  
	
	  we should probably mention that RELNOTES now contains this when we
	  release b12, and people should update it when they change
	  something that people upgrading to the next beta need to know, such
	  as config file option changes, kline format changes etc 
	- updated the confs to reflect whois_wait -> pace_wait_simple 
	- modified the ilog() for havent_read_conf=yes; slightly.  

2002-02-28 08:54  androsyn

	* src/client.c: localClient must have fd set to -1 upon creation
	otherwise it will have all sorts of weird problems.  

2002-02-28 07:12  androsyn

	* modules/: m_cjoin.c, m_kline.c: Removed a few strncpy()'s for
	strlcpy() 

2002-02-28 07:03  androsyn

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_user.c: Fixed bug with unknown in username and
	cleaned up some string abuses that were still around from
	strncpy_irc()

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_help.c, modules/m_info.c,
	modules/m_whois.c, modules/m_whowas.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c:

	/help 

2002-02-27 20:02  jmallett

	* adns/event.c, src/dynlink.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c: Bring
	back my uintptr_t casts to the code which converts dlsym(3)'s return 
	value to something we can make into a function pointer within the
	bounds of the C standard.  This is a hack as such, but it is far
	more "correct" than trying to convert two pointers to eachother, one
	being a data pointer (void*) and one being a function pointer. 
	Document this as such, as it is important to compilers like TenDRA,
	and also mention that I _do_ have something which is correct, but
	that for POLA sake, and since this will work pretty much everywhere,
	I am choosing not to put it in at this time.  
	
	Also, convert casts of socklen_t pointers from 'int*' to
	'socklen_t*'.  Originally these were 'unsigned int*', which is
	correct on BSDish systems, but may not be if for some reason
	socklen_t is signed (it isn't with BSD networking), and really
	'size_t foo; use(&foo)' doesn't need to be 'use((socklen_t *)&foo)',
	but it doesn't hurt anyway.  If this is causing problems on some
	system, if it does not have socklen_t, we should make socklen_t a
	signed integer on that system using our typedef'd version, as it is
	infinitely more common for these parameters to be 'socklen_t*' which 
	is not the same as 'int*'.  
	
	The current source tree will now build happily on TenDRA systems
	again.  

2002-02-27 19:13  jmallett

	* RELNOTES: Add a list of things which have changed since the last
	beta and which need testing to the Release Notes, as suggested by

	src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c, src/send.c: I have
	modified configure.in to detect shl_load and HP-UX Systems.  Then I
	modified modules.c and seperated some functions into dynlink.c 
	Rework has been done on some files, where declaration
	inconsistencies existed. Like static int and then only int for the
	same functions.  I believe the HP-UX porting is now completed.  

2002-02-27 10:28  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Correct an inversion of the last #define I
	committed.  

2002-02-27 10:20  androsyn

	encrypted = yes; and cryptlink = yes; distinction clearer Document
	the stripping of [ ] from serverinfo fields in LINKS 

2002-02-25 16:05  wcampbel

	* contrib/: m_flags.c, m_mkpasswd.c: I gave NO ONE permission to
	put m_flags.c and m_mkpasswd.c under the GPL.  

2002-02-25 15:52  leeh

	* src/packet.c: 
	- cleaned up some k+r and single space indenting 

2002-02-25 14:01  leeh

	* include/resv.h, src/resv.c: 
	- made resv use strlcpy() 
	- bumped RESVNICKLEN to NICKLEN*2 

2002-02-25 13:22  leeh

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- nick[NICKLEN + 2] -> nick[NICKLEN] 

2002-02-25 12:56  leeh

	* tools/convertklines.c: 
	- made convertklines use the new conf format 
	- cleanups, added support for oper reasons 

2002-02-25 12:12  androsyn

	* src/channel_mode.c: More stupidity related to people using
	NICKLEN and abusing strings...  

2002-02-25 12:09  androsyn

	* src/resv.c: Minor cleanup related to NICKLEN changes...  

2002-02-25 10:40  androsyn

	src/s_user.c, src/scache.c, src/whowas.c: Replace strncpy_irc()
	with strlcpy().  Change NICKLEN == 10, 9 + 1 for the NUL character. 
	I'm not sure if HOSTLEN and friends will need to be mangled as well,
	but we can explore that later.  

2002-02-24 13:32  lusky

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, include/patchlevel.h,
	src/s_log.c: 
	- revved patchlevel to -7b11

2002-02-24 10:37  leeh

	* src/client.c: 
	- also walk the unknowns list for dlines on check_klines() 
	  (bug reported by Paul Miseiko <teardrop@teardrop.ca>) 

2002-02-24 10:23  db

	* src/: s_user.c, send.c: 
	- Don't bother giving exit_client the socket name in dead_link 
	  it does not understand the %s convention dead_link() does and just
	  prints a '%s' instead. thats dumb.  
	- We had one place where we printed "Ghost" instead of "Ghosted
	  client" like everywhere else. fixed.  

2002-02-23 21:45  wcampbel

	* doc/operguide.txt: Updates to the Oper Guide:

2002-02-23 21:44  a1kmm

	* src/client.c: 
	- Added a #if 0 around the expensive asserts for now. Perhaps we
	  want a better define system later.  

2002-02-23 14:20  leeh

	* src/class.c:

2002-02-23 10:54  leeh

	* src/class.c: 
	- cleanups to get_client_ping 

2002-02-23 10:32  androsyn

	* src/s_user.c: Fix ping cookies..  

2002-02-23 08:30  leeh

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, src/client.c: 
	- added a kludged #define to hide server ips from everyone including
	  admins, I dont like this, but *shrug* 

2002-02-23 05:58  leeh

	* src/client.c: 
	- only check/set IsClosing/IsDead for local connections..  

2002-02-23 04:23  leeh

	* src/client.c: 
	- we only set IsDead for local clients 
	- the ->localClient->listener is already in the MyConnect() below? -
	  you cant try to access it if its not a local client..  

2002-02-22 22:29  a1kmm

	* src/: client.c, s_auth.c, s_user.c: 
	- Fixed the bug where we were leaving clients on the auth list until
	  after we parsed any commands waiting on their buffer(which meant
	  that if they got exited then, they would try to be removed from the
	  list they were already being removed from). I cannot get ircd to
	  core using any connection flooding or cloning test now.  
	- Left in my asserts() I wrote about a week ago. These are more
	  extensive and expensive than Androsyn's asserts, and we definitely
	  want them out before we release.  

2002-02-22 08:24  androsyn

	* src/s_serv.c: It seems cygwin really does need that damned
	vfork() 

2002-02-21 06:47  androsyn

	the lclient list when we try to free it...  

2002-02-19 08:22  androsyn

	* src/packet.c: Move an assert up a little bit..

	* doc/whats-new.txt: Documented CAP_PARA...  

2002-02-17 19:32  jmallett

	* src/client.c: Fix the bug reported by me and Wendy where we try
	to access the localClient structure which may be NULL, outside of a
	check for MyConnect.  This fixes the NULL dereference by putting it
	inside the if(MyConnect()).  

2002-02-17 18:30  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: Finally get around to testing src/modules.c on my
	old OSX box again.  Fixed a typo I managed to dissipate pretty well
	in the code of the word 'Modules'.  

2002-02-17 02:07  a1kmm

	* src/: s_serv.c, s_user.c: 
	- If you are removing a client from one list and putting them on to
	  another, after you have called send*, you have to check that the
	  client is not dead.  I have done this for register_local_user and
	  server_estab, but there may be other places where we move from one
	  list to another. I would appreciate it if someone can check this to
	  make sure it is okay to just return where I do etc... and that I
	don't check too early for IsDead() 

2002-02-17 01:34  a1kmm

	* src/: client.c, send.c: 
	- Do not call exit_client() again if a send error occurs while 
	  sending the queues for exit_client() 

2002-02-17 01:02  a1kmm

	* src/: client.c, s_bsd.c: 
	- Don't clean up the listener until the get to free_client. This
	  fixes the coredump in user_welcome() when the user has exited.  

2002-02-17 00:29  db

	* src/listener.c: 
	- mostly cosmetic. prototypes should be on separate lines, 
	- make formatting consistent with hybrid 'standard' 

2002-02-16 22:39  androsyn

	* include/client.h, modules/m_trace.c, src/client.c, src/hash.c,
	src/ircd.c, src/packet.c, src/parse.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c, src/send.c: Okay..I know this is a big
	ass commit, but it was driving me nuts.  I don't care if this delays
	an rc another week or two but its the right thing to do.  Basically
	move client_p->fd into client_p->localClient->fd.  If you don't like
	it, tough.  

2002-02-16 21:58  androsyn

	* src/send.c: Put the SetDead() back in there..  

2002-02-16 21:54  a1kmm

	* src/send.c: 
	- On second thoughts, don't close the fd if it is already -1.  

2002-02-16 21:52  a1kmm

	* src/send.c: 
	- Close the fd in dead_link() so we don't get into an infinite loop
	  by trying to send from exit_client().  

2002-02-16 21:38  androsyn

	* src/s_serv.c: Fixed a minor compile warning with an #ifdef 

2002-02-16 21:30  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Fix the way configure
	determines the kind of dl*(3) [or lack thereof] to use so that it
	will work hopefully on the widest variety of systems.  

2002-02-16 21:19  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: Include dlfcn.h if we have -ldl or dlopen(3),
	sorry A1kmm! 

2002-02-16 21:04  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: Superfluous checks before including dlfcn.h 

2002-02-16 20:56  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: Move our preprocessor definition for the dl*(3)
	shims for dyld systems to the appropriate location.  

2002-02-16 20:11  androsyn

	* src/: s_serv.c, send.c: Remove some extra SetDead() calls.  We
	are going straight into exit_client() anyways.  

2002-02-16 19:55  androsyn

	* src/s_serv.c: Fix cygwin from spewing all over the console..  

2002-02-16 19:48  androsyn

	* include/client.h, src/client.c, src/packet.c, src/send.c: Fixed
	the double exit_client() stuff I think...  

2002-02-16 18:27  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Fixed a tyop 

2002-02-16 17:54  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- We have a macro that does what the old code did, so lets use it.  
	- cosmetic change only 

2002-02-16 17:46  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: close_connection() needs to know about and close all
	servlink related connections including the ctrl connections and any
	of the pipes.  

2002-02-14 00:06  a1kmm

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- Removed a spurious NUMLISTS define. Although I still wonder why we
	  didn't stick to MAX_SUBLISTS.  

2002-02-13 22:50  a1kmm

	* src/: .depend, client.c, s_serv.c, send.c: 
	- A patch by mrtime14c to fix double frees, with some cleanups by 
	  Dianora and a minor fix by me.  

2002-02-13 11:41  jmallett

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_who.c, src/channel.c,
	src/channel_mode.c: Centralize the preprocessor definition that
	controls how many lists are needed depending on OANDV, and make use
	of it correctly.  

2002-02-13 11:39  jmallett

	* README.FIRST: Add a big screaming note about the need to make
	clean or make distclean when upgrading.  This probably won't really
	apply after a release, but still.  

2002-02-13 11:16  androsyn

	* modules/m_who.c, src/channel.c, src/channel_mode.c: Fixes the
	mode bugs we were talking about..  Submitted by: svatopluk@gmx.de 

2002-02-12 07:27  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: If we want to use 0-6, then modulo by 7, not by 6.  

2002-02-12 07:13  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: Be sure to return NULL from dlerror() if we have
	no error to speak of.  

2002-02-12 07:06  jmallett

	* src/modules.c: Log when a symbol is defined more than once. 
	Clarify when our first dlopen() is done.  Misc. cleanup of my dl*(3)
	stuff.  

2002-02-12 06:48  jmallett

	* README.FIRST: Add a note about the version of the OSX DevTools
	required to build ircd-hybrid with shared module support properly.  

2002-02-12 06:45  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in,
	src/modules.c: I finally sat down and wrote working dl*(3) shims
	for dyld systems that do not have their own. Based on the
	NSModule(3) manpage, and various header files.  
	
	Works on OSX 10.0.4 with December 2001 Development Tools.  

2002-02-11 16:06  jmallett

	* README.FIRST: Correct a note about byacc so that people don't
	feel hopeless when they find out their byacc is dying.  
	
	Submitted by:	Samuel in Spain (He emailed me about this being
	unclear) 

2002-02-10 16:47  db

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- cleaner patch for 'who 0' 

2002-02-10 14:24  db

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- Stop a /who 0 coring 
	  it would not core on fbsd because of libc, but does on solaris.  

2002-02-10 10:26  androsyn

	* src/ircd.c: Forgot to remove a debugging fprintf().  

2002-02-10 01:49  androsyn

	* src/ircd.c: Tweaks for the delay on the ioloop.  

2002-02-09 20:35  wcampbel

	* include/m_info.h, include/motd.h, include/s_conf.h,
	modules/m_rehash.c, src/ircd.c, src/motd.c: Removed the remnants of
	the old help system.  
	(U)HELP_MOTD enums, ConfigFileEntry.(u)helpfile elements, and calls
	to (Init|Read)MessageFile() on the help directories.  
	
	Approved by:	Diane 

2002-02-09 01:55  a1kmm

	* src/hook.c: 
	- Fixed a reference to memory shortly after it has been freed.  

2002-02-07 23:04  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Check for Apple's GCC, rework
	PICFLAGS a little.  

2002-02-07 21:55  lusky

	* include/patchlevel.h, src/adns.c: 
	- removed unusued dns_cancel_all function 
	- revved patchlevel to 7b10 

2002-02-07 20:26  jmallett

	* src/channel.c: Bring can_send into the logic that a server can
	send to a channel, because we allow servers to m_message() with a
	NOTICE, but the NOTICE always fails because of course they aren't on
	that channel. This doesn't affect PRIVMSG as that is stopped in
	m_privmsg().  
	
	Explained hastently to: Dianora 

2002-02-06 08:02  leeh

	* include/s_serv.h, modules/m_invite.c, src/adns.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- cleaned up K&R/single space indenting in adns.c 
	- added CAP_PARA 
	- if channel is +p, broadcast invite to CAP_PARA servers 

2002-02-05 20:37  ejb

	* clean.com: 
	- Added clean.com .. this is a hack and will go away as soon as i 
	  have a working top-level descrip.mms for VMS.  

2002-02-05 14:45  ejb

	* README.FIRST, README.PLATFORMS: 
	- Added VMS to list of supported platforms.  

2002-02-05 14:38  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Teach configure to determine
	whether $CC is SVR4 Source Generation System compliant, so we can
	use a shared interface, such as is done for PICFLAGS here. Since I
	had to add checks for Sun WorkShop anyway, I removed the SunOS
	checks... They didn't really make sense anyway in my opinion. I ran 
	this by a few people (both the patches and the idea), and it looked
	sane to them.  
	
	Right now we recognize the following SGS-ish compilers: 
		o) MIPSpro 
		o) Sun WorkShop 
		o) TenDRA 

2002-02-05 14:33  ejb

	* README.VMS, adns/setup.c, include/config.h, tools/descrip.mms: 
	- a few more VMS changes: 
	   use logical names, not hardcoded paths; 
	   fixed tools to compile mkpasswd properly; 
	   use IRCD$CONFDIR:RESOLV.CONF, not []RESOLV.CONF; 
	   brought README.VMS up to date.  

2002-02-05 13:16  leeh

	* modules/m_invite.c: 
	- disable invite propagation 

2002-02-05 07:37  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Add support for MIPSpro based
	on what the SGI ABI compiler manpage dictates, though MIPSpro will
	probably play nice with a different set of options... This needs
	tested, but I can't test it, so I'm going to commit it as it doesn't 
	break anything that wouldn't already be broken, and hope someone can
	test it.  

2002-02-05 04:42  leeh

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- dont allow spaces in network name (breaks 005) 

2002-02-04 21:04  wcampbel

	* INSTALL, README.FIRST: Update to INSTALL, reference convertklines 
	Cygwin IS currently supported, in a limited way.  

2002-02-04 19:40  jmallett

	* tools/viconf.c: Fix typo, viconf.c["Cant'", "Can't"] 

2002-02-04 19:20  ejb

	* Hybrid-team: changed my nick & email in Hybrid-team 

2002-02-04 14:07  ejb

	* adns/descrip.mms, include/res.h, modules/descrip.mms,
	modules/core/descrip.mms, src/descrip.mms, src/modules.c: 
	- fixed VMS compile; we generate [.modules]core.olb from 
	  [.modules.core]*.c, and link against [.src]ircd.exe along 
	  with modules.olb.  NOT tested for runtime yet, also still need 
	  to fix config.h paths (so binaries can be distributed).  

2002-02-04 12:14  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: The bugfix that went in -6. Well here it is for -7.  

2002-02-04 09:56  leeh

	* Hybrid-team, modules/.depend: 
	- added jmallet^3 to hybteam 

2002-02-04 09:31  jmallett

	* README.PLATFORMS: Correct my name, s/Joseph/J./ 

2002-02-04 08:22  jmallett

	* configure: Regenerate configure with autoconf 2.13 

2002-02-04 08:17  jmallett

	* autoconf/configure.in: Add rtsigio to the list of things we can't
	find if we can't find any selection paradigm. However I am not sure
	if we should automagically try this as it is marked experimental...
	? 

2002-02-04 05:51  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Check errno, before we whine to the oper about
	being able to accept the connection or not.  

2002-02-04 00:03  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_sigio.c: This should keep us from calling fcntl() on
	every read or write.  

2002-02-03 23:11  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_sigio.c: Back out the changes Andrew made that tried to
	call the handler in comm_setselect() as these are not needed now.  

2002-02-03 23:07  androsyn

	* src/: s_bsd_sigio.c, s_serv.c: Minor bugfixes with fcntl() 

2002-02-03 22:17  androsyn

	* src/: channel.c, client.c, linebuf.c: Some tweaks to the default
	block heap sizes.. The should reduce initial memory consumption by a
	bit.  

2002-02-03 21:52  androsyn

	* modules/m_rehash.c: Ponder..who took out cleanup_channels() from
	rehash channels anyways..  

2002-02-03 21:29  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in,
	src/listener.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c: Fix the RT
	Sigio code on linux once and for all.  Somebody other than me should
	test this and give me some feedback.  

2002-02-03 11:58  androsyn

	* modules/: m_kline.c, m_trace.c: A few changes that will keep code
	from directly calling time() by itself.  It now calls set_time(),
	updating SystemTime(and CurrentTime), and uses CurrentTime directly.  

2002-02-02 09:01  leeh

	* help/Makefile.in: 
	- dont build index files by default, we can keep them updated and in
	cvs 

2002-02-02 08:56  leeh

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- patch to fix HAVE_SNPRINTF HAVE_VSNPRINTF via Giorgos Keramidas 
	  <keramida@freebsd.org> 

2002-02-02 08:34  leeh

	* include/supported.h, src/s_user.c: 
	- 005 was exceeding MAPARAMS, so added a second 005 set, which
	  includes the missing NETWORK=%s 

2002-02-02 08:25  leeh

	* src/parse.c: 
	- if we were exceeding the param count, we werent stripping off the
	  : (like we do if we dont exceed it), so we were ending up with ::::
	across servers 

2002-02-01 09:48  wcampbel

	* README.FIRST: Document the requirement that /etc/ services,
	protocols, and resolv.conf must be readable by the ircd user in
	order for the server to start.  

2002-01-31 21:13  wcampbel

	* doc/challenge.txt: Updated the challenge/response document from
	the SGML source.  

2002-01-30 07:59  leeh

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_set.c, src/client.c: 
	- commited patch to fix check_splitmode() wrt events from 
	  Giorgos Keramidas <keramida@ceid.upatras.gr> 

2002-01-29 23:48  androsyn

	* src/ircd.c: Keep people from starting ircd as root.  

2002-01-28 13:58  leeh

	* contrib/: example_module.c, m_flags.c, m_jupe.c, m_map.c,
	m_mkpasswd.c: 
	- commited hwys patch for contrib/ 

2002-01-27 12:05  leeh

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	- commited hwys fix for the makefile 

2002-01-26 13:16  db

	* src/channel.c: Don't use strlen() when sprintf() already returns
	it 

2002-01-23 11:14  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- fixed the invisible stuff reported by andro..  

2002-01-23 10:59  leeh

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- added an !IsRegistered check to hunt_server, else we would forward
	  trace requests to a client that had sent NICK but not USER 

2002-01-22 10:21  davidt

	* include/client.h, src/client.c: 
	- Add client_p->free_file and client_p->free_line.  
	  When exit_client() is called, it records the line/file it was
	  called from in the client struct, and if the client has already
	  been added to the dead_list, it will fail an assert leaving
	  free_[file|line] to be examined.  
	- This should be backed out before releasing, all changes are
	  wrapped in #ifdef DUPFREEDEBUG 

2002-01-21 23:11  androsyn

	* src/s_user.c: Fixed the ping cookie bug..now we need to fix the
	negative user count crap..  

2002-01-21 20:02  androsyn

	* src/client.c: An assert that should catch this double free bug.
	Basically we check to make sure the client isn't already on the dead
	list.  

2002-01-19 23:26  jmallett

	* include/memory.h: Add support for pulling in inttypes on VMS for
	uintptr_t.  Obtained partially from:	ejb 

2002-01-16 15:21  leeh

	* modules/m_invite.c: 
	- check_channel_name returns an int, not null..  

2002-01-16 09:02  jmallett

	* include/: hook.h, memory.h: Move my uintptr_t checks to memory.h,
	since it works with pointers and belongs there moreso than hook.h
	and now we can build on OpenBSD! 

2002-01-16 08:47  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/hook.h,
	include/setup.h.in: If we have <inttypes.h> include it for use of
	uintptr_t. If we don't, we check to see if we have uintptr_t
	normally. If we do not, define it as an unsigned long, as that
	should work on most/all platforms.  

2002-01-14 13:17  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- we needed a send_umode() for local clients..  

2002-01-13 17:56  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: I will compile before I commit.  I will compile
	before I commit.  

2002-01-13 17:01  leeh

	* contrib/: m_clearchan.c, m_ojoin.c, m_opme.c: 
	- updated to revision stuff 

2002-01-13 16:49  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- removing it is better than a debug #if 0 

2002-01-13 16:47  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- fixed the double mode crap 

2002-01-13 16:33  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Add a check for mmap() failure.  

2002-01-13 16:22  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- fixed a stupid: wed mixed FLAGS_INVISIBLE into both sptr->umodes
	  and sptr->flags, so a user being invisible, was never told it unless
	  they forced the mode themselves ;) 

2002-01-13 11:54  wcampbel

	* BUGS, TODO, contrib/README, doc/index.txt, doc/whats-new.txt,
	tools/README: Doc updates Removed build_one, I'm sick of larne's
	whining 

2002-01-13 11:31  wcampbel

	* Makefile.in, RELNOTES, doc/ircd.8: Reference beta10 rather than
	beta8 

2002-01-13 09:22  db

	* src/channel.c: Smokey the coder says, only you can stop cute
	wrong code! <   if (who) --- >   if (who != NULL) 

2002-01-13 08:02  jmallett

	* modules/core/m_message.c: Move fl_'s check for a server sending a
	PRIVMSG into m_privmsg, and just return there, instead of going into
	m_message and _then_ checking for PRIVMSG or NOTICE.  

2002-01-13 07:58  jmallett

	* modules/core/m_message.c: As we now check much earlier on to see
	if a server is trying to PRIVMSG, take out the !IsPerson conditional
	here, so a server can indeed NOTICE a channel, in the case of, for
	example, saying someone cannot be opped at this time as the server
	is in split more (or things like channel flooding even!) 

2002-01-13 00:19  jmallett

	* src/hostmask.c: Fixing some comments, since they'll get fixed
	eventually anyway: 
	- "an possible" -> "a possible" 

2002-01-13 00:11  jmallett

	* contrib/spy_whois_notice.c: Make spy_whois_notice.c's _version
	use #Revision# 

2002-01-13 00:02  jmallett

	* include/s_bsd.h: Update comments about READBUF_SIZE 

2002-01-12 17:41  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Fixed yet another wacky and weird /rehash dns bug..  

2002-01-12 16:06  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c: 
	- chanops != chanops_voiced 

2002-01-12 13:08  leeh

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- servers shouldnt send privmsgs.. we have to allow notices for
	  stuff like remote klines etc, but there should be no reason for a
	privmsg at all 

2002-01-12 11:45  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Portability fixing 
	- if the autoconf check for working '-g' failed, don't shove '-g'
	  down the IRC_CFLAGS of an unknown compiler, if it does work, add it
	  by default.  Checks for specific compilers ala TenDRA should be done
	  if it is known to produce bad code :) 

2002-01-12 11:38  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in, src/hook.c,
	src/ircd.c, src/modules.c: Add still more fixups for using TenDRA
	out of the box with Hybrid7.  
	
	- configure magic to stop autoconf from slamming '-g' into CFLAGS 
	  just because it doesn't explicitly break compiling NULL files 
	  Thanks to: Andrew Clausen for helping me think around this 
	- configure magic to make autoconf pick up the right types and 
	  includes on the host system, since autoconf uses CPPFLAGS to 
	  check for includes and types, and TenDRA does standards checking 
	  even when acting as a plain preprocessor, or whatever autoconf 
	  is making it do 
	- configure magic to check for <sys/resource.h>, use accordingly.  
	- we can't _really_ convert directly between data type pointers to 
	  function pointers, so convert to a faceless intermediary type
	  first, namely uintptr_t (as defined by ISO -- should always
	exist?).  

2002-01-10 21:00  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: Corrected some of the items that Lee recently
	changed in the parser.  It's still not properly done...this whole
	doc MUST be rewritten soon.  

2002-01-10 14:54  jmallett

	* Hybrid-team: Sort in nick alphabetical order, as advertised.  

2002-01-10 14:36  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Add proper TenDRA support to
	our configure script. Not only can we detect if someone is trying to
	use TenDRA, we can also set up the necessary string of IRC_CFLAGS to
	work on most platforms, and we can produce shared modules! 

2002-01-10 13:45  jmallett

	* iauth/source/auth.c, iauth/source/mtree.c, iauth/source/sock.c,
	src/ircdauth.c: Second round of my commits to change zero and
	pointer comparing in assertions.  This time do ones in the form of
	'assert(ptr [!=]= 0)', reverse of last sweep.

	* src/s_bsd.c: Turn off disable_sock_options if we have IPV6 set
	up. The real solution is to do "proper" things for IPV6 here but
	using IPPROTO_IPV6 just makes protocol unavailable messages instead.
	So Here it is disabled, a temporary and seemingly satisfactory fix.  

2002-01-10 08:59  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, src/Makefile.in,
	src/snprintf.c: Conditionalise src/snprintf.c on whether or not we
	actually need it using configure! This also means we don't need to
	produce a bogus non-empty translation unit for strict compilers like
	TenDRA, Forte, and aCC.

	* README.PLATFORMS: I suppose I'll claim Linux on x86 and sparc

	* README.PLATFORMS: I guess I'll take the punish^H^H^H^H^Hleasure
	of handling Cygwin issues :) 

2002-01-09 17:51  jmallett

	* README.PLATFORMS: Reformat the table to have space for 'Mac OS X'
	in the OS area. Also I'll support both Darwin and Mac OS X users.
	The two are orthogonal sometimes.  

2002-01-09 17:31  joant

	* README.PLATFORMS: ircd-hybrid-7/README.PLATFORMS 

2002-01-09 17:15  jmallett

	* README.FIRST, README.PLATFORMS: Since supporting Hybrid on every
	platform someone would run it on is important, add a document
	including people who want to take responsibility for, as well as who
	to yell at when things blow up. Add myself appropriately as the
	NetBSD and OpenBSD on SPARC with GCC person, as well as Darwin on
	PPC with Apple's version of gcc, and TenDRA on FreeBSD/x86.  The BSD
	on SPARC stuff doesn't currently work because of GCC, but I'll still
	take responsibility and try to help people with Hybrid on that pair 
	of platforms.  

2002-01-09 16:58  jmallett

	* README.FIRST: Add notes about Darwin and Mac OS X and GCC on
	SPARC and UltraSPARC that I've run into in my portability checks.  

2002-01-09 12:38  jmallett

	* tools/mkpasswd.c: Extraneous extern optind. We don't use optind
	anywhere right now, so we don't need its definition.  

2002-01-09 10:38  jmallett

	* src/: client.c, s_bsd.c, s_gline.c, s_serv.c, s_user.c, whowas.c: 
	Clean up a number of uses of "assert(0 != pointer)" and "assert(0 ==
	pointer)" and use NULL instead, since that will always do the right
	thing.  

2002-01-09 10:30  db

	* src/match.c: 
	- 0 != ptr is just _WRONG_ 

2002-01-09 10:16  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, include/supported.h,
	modules/m_info.c, src/channel_mode.c, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- updated /info to cover everything in ircd.conf at current 
	- renamed the following variables for consistency: 
	  maxbans -> max_bans 
	  allow_hidden -> disable_hidden 
	  split_server/user_count -> default_split_server/user_count 
	- added pace_wait to example.conf

	* modules/m_gline.c, src/match.c:

2002-01-09 09:19  leeh

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_stats.c, src/hostmask.c: 
	- made stats k/K use find_conf_by_address instead of
	  find_address_conf saves us looping twice, once for an auth, once for
	a kline..  
	- hence removed the extra parm to report_Klines 

2002-01-09 05:27  jmallett

	* src/memory.c: Oops, meant to do cvs ci src/memory.c and did cvs
	ci -m src/memory.c 
	
	Anyway, correct usage of mem_frob (instead of memfrob()) and put it
	inside #ifndef NDEBUG.  

2002-01-09 05:20  jmallett

	* src/: client.c, memory.c: src/memory.c 

2002-01-08 17:53  jmallett

	* modules/m_gline.c: Document GLine interfaces somewhat slightly,
	including inputs and what we're doing with so many inputs! 

2002-01-08 09:23  jmallett

	* src/client.c: Add an assertion to make sure the head of the list
	of channels a user being exited is in is really NULL. This is
	manifesting itself in strange ways later on and we need to head it
	off here.  

2002-01-07 13:32  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Fix OS/compiler logic in
	configure to be slightly more generic than checking for using gcc in
	the SunOS case, in case we decide to include support for generic
	portable compilers like TenDRA or OpenWatcom or such, and they have
	different options for PIC code.  

2002-01-07 10:48  jmallett

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Bring in my slightly redone PIC
	checks. Fixes GCC on SunOS problems with the previous version of my
	changes here. Also include some notes about what is being done for
	PIC checks.

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- added oper accountability back to kills via quits 
	- fixes for -6, which takes the nick of the killer from the front of
	  the path - so set path = source_p->name when bogus..  
	- cleanups 

2002-01-06 11:16  leeh

	- Added a consistant header to all ircd files as suggested under the
	  GPL version 2 license. This will ensure that we as coders are
	  protected against inclusion of our code into commercial projects,
	  and more importantly, liability for anything that might go wrong.

	Approved by:	me.  

2001-12-20 21:11  db

	* modules/m_oper.c:

	- dont check to->from->from! 

2001-12-20 13:23  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- ripped host=""; from shared {}; and made it use user="user@host";
	  like the rest of the config does..  
	- this MAY cause issues with older confs 

2001-12-20 12:31  androsyn

	* src/ircd_parser.y: Fixed oper {} so that a block with a key set
	and no password is counted as valid.  

2001-12-20 11:38  leeh

2001-12-19 02:59  a1kmm

	* modules/.depend, src/.depend, src/client.c, src/list.c,
	src/memory.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd_sigio.c: 
	- Fixed an uninitialised memory reference into localClient that was
	  coring m_challenge.  
	- s_bsd_sigio now updates the time :) 
	- changed the order of some things to cope with the immediate
	  callback from comm_setselect.  
	- Re-added an O_NONBLOCK previously taken out - it caused the adns
	  socket to end up blocking, which is a bad thing.  
	- Moved the #ifdef USE_SIGIO back down - it break make depend where
	it was.  
	- Remade depend with the right headers.  
	- Added a memfrob in the debugging code to catch uninitialised
	memory.  

2001-12-18 20:21  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Make our #define of INADDR_LOOPBACK host byte
	order...  

2001-12-18 20:09  androsyn

	* src/: channel.c, client.c: Change the default allocations for

2001-12-18 08:38  wcampbel

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: Repo moved the backup from developers into here
	and applied Lee's fix.  Repo moves are better as they do not lose
	history.  

2001-12-18 08:36  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_sigio.c: Move the #ifdef for USE_SIGIO a bit further up
	in the code..  

2001-12-18 08:33  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_sigio.c: Minor cleanups...  

2001-12-18 01:42  a1kmm

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd.c: 
	- Made s_auth reschedule if no data is read on the first pass. This
	  is needed for sigio to work properly as we need to try reading at
	  once to tell the kernel to send the signal next time. Note that if
	  any auth data is received, it still must all be received in the same
	  packet. This should be a non-risky commit.  
	- Changed an assert() to an if () return; This was needed because
	  with SIGIO a call to comm_setselect from a handler that was not
	  called by comm_setselect can result in a call to the handler, which
	  caused re-entrancy problems with the assert. As the assert() should
	  never happen, this should not affect the rest of the ircd.
	  Additionally, it is a better action in the case it does happen if
	  NDEBUG is defined, as that would otherwise result in the ircd 
	coring(probably).  

2001-12-18 00:20  a1kmm

	* src/s_bsd_sigio.c: 
	- Fixed sigio; we now try to read/write immediately when a handler
	  is set but wasn't before on comm_setselect() 

2001-12-17 10:06  leeh

	* include/s_gline.h, modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_stats.c,
	src/s_gline.c: 
	- if something is glined, cleanup_glines() will now remove it from
	  the pending list 
	- call cleanup_glines() after we add a gline 
	- check find_is_glined() earlier in majority_gline - why check for
	  duplicate votes when its not going to matter anyway? :) 

2001-12-16 04:36  leeh

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_stats.c, src/hostmask.c:

	* modules/: m_info.c, m_motd.c, m_version.c:

	- allow remote versions, depending on serverhide

2001-12-14 22:34  a1kmm

	* modules/.depend, modules/Makefile.in, src/.depend,
	src/Makefile.in: 
	- Fixed .depend system to work properly with CVS, so we don't always
	  end up committing .depend. .depend changes should now be rare.  
	  Please do not commit after make depend from a non-gcc box unless
	  you are sure that your compiler is not including system headers.
	  Other than that .depend should be universal so we shouldn't
	experience any problems.

	  Never need to read it back in.  

2001-12-14 09:47  androsyn

2001-12-13 03:29  leeh

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y:

2001-12-12 11:23  db

	  purely cosmetic. Just for consistency.

	src/s_bsd_kqueue.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c, src/s_bsd_select.c,
	src/s_bsd_sigio.c: 
	- Fixed dependencies so they are saved to a file ".depend". This
	  means that building doesn't depend on sed, and it fixes the problems
	  admins on boxes that don't support cc -MM by allowing the .depend
	  file to already exist in the tarball.  
	- Moved all the #include "file" that were inside a #ifdef out of
	  them so that we always have dependencies at least as strong as they
	  should be.  
	- Wrapped rsa.h in #ifdef HAVE_LIBCRYPTO so we can include it even
	  when we don't have libcrypto.  
	- Took the dependency build out of configure.  
	- Added a depend target to help/Makefile.in 
	- Added a $Id$ tag to help/Makefile.in so commit doesn't complain.

	- Follow-up fix for s_iphost.  

2001-12-09 20:52  jdc

	* modules/m_knock.c, src/channel.c: 
	- Renamed s_host to src_host; s_host is reserved on Solaris 8,
	  apparently.  s_ipaddr also renamed to src_ipaddr to keep
	consistency.  

2001-12-09 20:15  jdc

	* iauth/source/: misc.c, sock.c: 
	- More 'register' declaration removals.

	* src/adns.c: Remove two stupid comments from adns.c 

2001-12-06 08:02  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Fix a coredump in adns.c on rehash.  Basically if
	there were any pending events, adns would dump core upon the timeout
	of that event.  We now timeout *all* pending dns requests on a
	/rehash dns, making them fail no matter what.  

2001-12-04 07:13  ejb

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- fix a bug where we always sent CAP_ZIP even if the link wasn't
	zipped.  

2001-12-04 02:32  leeh

	* modules/m_topic.c: 
	- only for +s chans it is :P 

2001-12-04 02:00  leeh

	* modules/m_topic.c: 
	- dont send TOPICWHO if theyre not members 

2001-12-04 01:30  db

	  ENC:BF/256,BF/256 -> ENC:BF/256 

2001-12-02 08:00  leeh

	* BUGS, include/s_conf.h, modules/m_rehash.c, modules/m_unkline.c,
	src/ircd.c, src/modules.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- make MODRESTART cause a rehash, to reload modules from the conf 
	- rehash() was taking source_p and client_p, yet doing nothing with
	  them, so dont bother passing them 

2001-12-02 07:30  leeh

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- $server -> $$server 
	- #host.mask -> $#host.mask 

2001-12-02 07:11  leeh

	* modules/m_knock.c: 
	- commited KNOCK stuff.. clients doing a KNOCK on a LL will have the
	  uplink answer their queries, theres a bit of kludging here.. but it
	works 

2001-12-02 06:31  leeh

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- fixed up the hostname/username checking, we dont need to pass
	  source_p (its always gunna be the same as client_p anyway) and due
	  to the fact we dont prefix nick - source_p isnt always where the
	nick originated..  

2001-12-02 05:55  leeh

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- cleanups 

2001-12-02 05:11  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- removed an extra : 

2001-12-02 05:08  leeh

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- dont give out ips on fake direction of NICK 

2001-12-02 05:05  leeh

	* modules/m_topic.c: 
	- if serverhide is on and a LL forwards us a topic request - if
	  we're masking who set the topic, mask it to the LLs servername, not
	ours..  

2001-11-30 12:04  db

	* include/ircd_defs.h: 
	- Well, that definition is obsolete.  

2001-11-30 09:59  androsyn

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_topic.c: Made topic_info a part of
	struct Channel and not just a pointer 

2001-11-30 08:18  davidt

	* modules/m_knock.c: 
	- oops, also introduce unknown clients to LL servers when
	propigating KNOCK 

2001-11-30 08:06  davidt

	* modules/m_knock.c: only pass KNOCK to servers which know about
	chptr (LL fix) 

2001-11-30 06:45  leeh

	* modules/m_knock.c: 
	- propagate knock remotely..  
	
	  there still needs to be LL stuff in here 

2001-11-30 02:52  a1kmm

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- Removed extraneous argument in a kill_client.  

2001-11-30 02:45  a1kmm

	* include/send.h, modules/m_invite.c, modules/core/m_message.c,
	src/send.c: 
	- Ran m_message.c and send.c through indent - they were unreadable 
	  before because of tabs.  
	- Cleaned up send.h - removed separate __GNUC__ and not gnuc
	  prototypes and made a single macro to give format attributes.
	  Removed prototypes for functions which no longer exist.  
	- Made sendto_remote_list work and send a linebuf once to every
	  remote user on the list.  
	- Don't require remote users to be in the channel to invite.  
	- Fixed vchan naming and propagation issues.  
	- Don't send error about a user being in channel if they are in
	  another vchan which is secret when you invite them(silently ignore).  
	- Don't send error about a user being on a different server if
	  server hiding is on and they are invited to a local channel(silently
	ignore).  
	- Propagate invite to all servers where there are chanops or
	  halfops, as well as to where the invited user resides.  
	- Send a notice to all local chanops and halfops if a channel is +p 
	  when someone invites.  
	- Don't accept privmsg/notice for local channels from servers.  
	- Don't send privmsg/notice for local channels to servers.  
	- Only propagate @%+ channel messages to servers that have ops, 
	  half-ops or ops, and halfops-ops-voiced respectively.  
	- Allow privmsg from servers - it is stupid not to when we allow 
	  notices from servers.  
	- Killed the mallocs and reallocs in the message code - we now use a 
	  static buffer.  
	- Probably introduced a few bugs because I'm tired(but hopefully
	not).

	include/s_serv.h, modules/m_knock.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/messages.tab, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- added first half of knock stuff.. the remote propagation doesnt
	  exist yet, and the numerics needadding to messages/* 
	
	  but ive run out of time, ill finish later :P 

2001-11-29 08:57  db

	* src/: messages.tab, numeric.c: Removed unnecessary casting on
	NULL in messages.tab be a bit more paranoid in numeric.c 

2001-11-28 22:53  db

	* include/numeric.h, modules/m_knock.c, src/messages.tab,
	src/numeric.c: 
	- KNOCK is now using a numeric at least on local server.  
	- numeric.c was not checking all validity 

2001-11-28 18:54  db

	* include/send.h: -fixed prototype for sento_channel_remote 

2001-11-28 18:27  jdc

	* include/rsa.h, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	* include/rsa.h: 
	  - Remove #include <openssl/rsa.h>.  #include in include files ==
	  yuck.  
	* modules/m_cryptlink.c: 
	  - Re-order #include statements, particularly rsa.h being included
	    BEFORE <openssl/rsa.h> 
	  - Remove #include for <openssl/bio.h> and <openssl/pem.h>.  FYI,
	    the pem.h include breaks a lot of things due to OpenSSL's include
	    structure being a gigantic mess.  
	* src/s_serv.c 
	  - Same as modules/m_cryptlink.c, for the most part.  
	* src/ircd.c 
	  - Tinker with the pid file writing stuff.  Made it an unsigned
	    int, vs.  just an int.  Little more verbose if fbputs() fails too.  

2001-11-28 18:03  db

	* include/send.h, modules/m_knock.c, modules/core/m_message.c,
	src/send.c: 
	- This re-adds remote KNOCK capability in the same way it was done
	  in h6.  Its not a good way of doing it. There should be a KNOCK
	  CAPAB for h7 servers to lessen the traffic sent for a KNOCK. There
	  should also be some NUMERICS here instead of notices.  

2001-11-28 10:48  db

	* src/: parse.c, send.c: tiny format change in parse.c 
	
	The guts of it is here. When using sendto_match_butone() which is
	=only= used to do the "oper magic" messages. i.e. /msg $server.mask
	and /msg #hostmask The prefix sent to remote servers is only the
	nick, not the nick!user@host.  The prefix sent to local users is
	nick!user@host 

2001-11-28 06:47  leeh

	* modules/core/m_kick.c, src/channel_mode.c: 
	- dont allow halfops to kick halfops, or set +/-h 
	- allowing +h to set bans, but not see a real banlist is daft 
	- halfops can also set simple modes 

2001-11-28 05:34  leeh

	* include/channel_mode.h, src/channel_mode.c: 
	- undef BOUNCE_BAD_HOPS by default and reenable for release.  

2001-11-28 05:33  leeh

	* src/channel_mode.c: 
	- attempt at fixing up +a.. there was a bogus if() that was
	  preventing resyncs when setting -a, amongst other things.. (unsure
	  if it was ok to remove, hunt for the XXX) 
	
	  theres still a bug where setting -ao will give a user the oplist..  

2001-11-27 11:30  davidt

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c, src/packet.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- Yet more linebuf fixes.  
	  * Rename 'binary' flag 'raw', since it was confusing people, and 
	    didn't reflect what the code actually did.  
	  * Initialise binary/raw flag to 0, to avoid bogusly stripping 
	    \r\n from sent data.  
	  * Fix linebuf_get to correctly strip leading \r\n from data, when 
	    required, instead of removing the correct number of bytes from 
	    the _end_ of the string.  

2001-11-26 17:49  davidt

	* contrib/: m_flags.c, m_map.c, m_mkpasswd.c:

	- Fix m_opme.c to compile 

2001-11-26 13:25  a1kmm

	* src/: ircd.c, linebuf.c: 
	- Let's initialise the resolver in the right place...  

2001-11-26 11:01  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Apply fix as discussed on mailing list and IRC.  
	  * Do not incorrectly terminate buffer simply because we ran out of
	    data to _read_.  

2001-11-26 05:27  androsyn

	* src/adns.c, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	doc/example.conf: Okay..the dns_host stuff was a good idea..but its
	a chicken vs the egg problem.  The parser needs to setup the
	dns_host stuff..but the parser relies on the resolver being started
	already...oh well..  This removes the dns_host and dns_port option 

2001-11-26 00:38  a1kmm

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Fixed a bug to stop carriage returns or linefeeds making their way
	  into messages under some cases.  

2001-11-24 19:59  wcampbel

	* doc/Makefile.in: With the new help system, opers.txt and

	src/s_conf.c: Added dns_host and dns_port to server info.  Modified

	it is really only using a single list now.  Also modified the
	timeout parameters for ADNS.  Added a flag to comm_connect_tcp() so
	that the caller can pass a timeout.  We needed this to reduce the

2001-10-21 12:03  davidt

	* src/channel_mode.c: 
	- Some misc. fixes for bugs in channel_mode.c 
	  (-o+h was sent to clients as -o+h+o, +o on a +v'd client was sent 
	   locally as -v+o, but all remote servers converted it to plain +o, 
	   minor other things).

	modules/core/m_kick.c, modules/core/m_message.c,
	modules/core/m_mode.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- Commit of fixed table mode code: 
	   * Non USE_TABLE_MODE code is gone.  If we commit this patch, we
	     go with USE_TABLE mode.  
	   * The TABLE_MODE code has been broken out into channel_mode.[ch].  
	   * -o on +a channels has been fixed to show the user being deopped
	     the mode change, and to resync their oplist.  
	   * +a on channels has been fixed to resync the channel's oplist.  
	   * The code has been cleaned up, although it's still a bit icky in
	     some places, but there shouldn't be any weird mystical -1/0/1
	     constants lying around anymore.  
	   * +b/-b from servers is NOT pretty_mask'ified (like the old code,
	     I beleive).  
	   * -b from clients will be pretty_mask'ed, but if that doesn't
	     match a ban on the channel, the original, un prettified mask is
	   checked.  
	* Misc other bug fixes.  
	   * Misc other bugs introduced. (probably :) 
	
	- If BOUNCE_BAD_HOPS is #define'd, the following is also done: 
	   * +h is translated to +o for non CAP_HOPS servers 
	     except towards the target's own server 
	     (i.e. no priviledges can be gained using this).  
	   * -h is translated to -o for non CAP_HOPS servers (this can never 
	     happen towards the target's own server).  
	   * -o is translated to -h from non CAP_HOPS servers.  
	   * A +h on a client which is linked through a non CAP_HOPS server 
	     is bounced back to the server that sent it (or dropped if from 
	     a client) as sendto_one(client_p, ":%s MODE %s -h %s", me.name, 
	     chptr->chname, target_p->name). [Although multiple bounces 
	     are merged into one MODE].  Assuming source_p is a client, 
	     a notice is also sent back.  Note that this notice will
	     probably break serverhiding, so something should be done about
	     this if we want to use BOUNCE_BAD_HOPS.  
	   * BOUNCE_BAD_HOPS will allow mixed CAP_HOPS/non CAP_HOPS nets to
	     work sanely(ish), by ensuring the whole net will see the client
	     as privileged, or unprivileged, and the clients local server will
	     never see a +h'd user as +o'd.  
	- This will probably have a few bugs, but it needs a few linked
	  servers to test properly.  

2001-10-20 19:16  davidt

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- Back out memset of ConfigChannel and ConfigFileEntry, since CVS
	  has been broken due to it for ages.  We need to zero it before we
	  read the config files, but we have to initialize the /SET options
	  after reading the conf files, so this is the wrong function.  
	  Also zeroing ConfigFileEntry won't work too well since we store
	  the config/kline/etc filenames in there.  
	  This might take a while to fix, which is why I'm backing out the
	  change so people can upgrade.

	  dereference the invalid pointer(which we don't). This saves a few
	clockticks.  
	- Optimised a little by not bothering to check the terminating NULL
	  of a hostmask is not a wildcard.  

2001-10-12 21:41  db

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/hostmask.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	- Bug fixes contributed by  Ben Winslow <rain@bluecherry.net> 

2001-10-12 20:29  wcampbel

	* contrib/m_ojoin.c: Added the old m_cinfo and m_ojoin modules to
	our devel tree.  They may not be the most up to date versions...but
	they are here 

2001-10-11 20:51  wcampbel

	* contrib/README: Updated the README to be consistant with the
	deletes I did earlier.  

2001-10-11 16:21  davidt

	* modules/m_info.c, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Prevent use_halfops from being changed at runtime, as that would
	  Break Stuff(TM).  
	- Add use_* to m_info.c 

2001-10-11 13:15  wcampbel

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/configure.in,
	contrib/Makefile.in: Completed repo move/cleanup.  It will now
	build again, you MAY have to do a clean checkout after this...  

2001-10-11 11:09  db

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- updated with current EFNet requirements, note that HOPS (half ops) 
	  is not presently accepted on EFNet.  

2001-10-11 10:18  jdc

	* include/ircd.h, src/channel.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	* Make use_halfops adjust sending HOPS capability.  
	* Added default_server_capabs to ircd.c; this contains the default 
	  startup capabilities (CAP_MASK), with certain ones AND+NOT'd out 
	  based on server configuration (i.e. use_halfops = no).  
	* s_serv.c had CAP_MASK replaced with default_server_capabs.  

2001-10-11 08:41  jdc

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	* Support for channel {} block command "use_halfops".  Default is
	  yes.  The code which uses the use_halfops variable hasn't been
	  written yet, though.  This is just for the config and what not.  

2001-10-10 19:42  androsyn

	* src/Makefile.in: Forgot to commit Makefile.in 

2001-10-10 19:39  androsyn

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure, include/irc_string.h,
	include/setup.h.in, src/snprintf.c: Added a vsnprintf() stolen from
	mutt that is necessary on platforms that do not have any native
	vsnprintf() 

2001-10-10 11:50  davidt

	* src/modules.c: 
	- Slightly modified version of poptix's patch, just check len > 3
	  before testing [len-3], and cache the result of strlen.  

2001-10-09 06:47  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in,
	src/irc_string.c: Gee..I broke another beta.  I forgot to remove
	the rest of the strtok_r() crap. oops 

2001-10-08 20:37  lusky

	* include/patchlevel.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- revved patchlevel to beta8 
	- removed unused variable 

2001-10-08 09:44  davidt

	* BUGS: 
	- Reword the /MODUNLOAD core entry to be more accurate, and include 
	  a simpler workaround.  We should perhaps default to 
	  --disable-shared-modules, but with some way to easily add
	  additional contrib modules automagically.  

2001-10-08 07:13  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: Removed the macro for strtoken() 

2001-10-07 20:05  db

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c: 
	- Look sorry, I know, but this code was just too stupid for words...  

2001-10-07 01:57  leeh

	* contrib/README: 
	- updated README to cover whats actually in contrib/ 

2001-10-06 11:32  leeh

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- we need to set the time on gline2, not gline1..  

2001-10-06 10:51  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: Added a change to allow strtok_r() to work
	without warnings..  

2001-10-06 10:35  androsyn

	* adns/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in, servlink/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in, tools/Makefile.in: Added change to the make depend
	rule so that IRCD_PREFIX is defined.  

2001-10-06 07:26  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- commented where the magic number 6 comes from 

2001-10-05 21:24  db

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/balloc.c: 
	- reformatted balloc.c to project standard format 
	- added part of Lee's proposed m_sjoin.c patches. We are simply 
	  being very very anal IMO.  

2001-10-05 19:50  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Fixed the stupid core related to typecasting. I'll
	fix the warnings on sun later 

2001-10-05 19:33  wcampbel

	* src/ircd.c: Removed the "value of NOFILE" message 

2001-10-04 20:46  db

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- three eventAdds() completely missing in latest... oops 
	  missing cleanup_channels, cleanup_glines and cleanup_tklines 

2001-10-04 14:26  androsyn

	* contrib/Makefile.in: contrib/ is all happy too 

2001-10-04 14:22  androsyn

	* tools/: convertklines.c, encspeed.c: Even more warnings I missed 

2001-10-04 14:22  androsyn

	* servlink/: io.c, io.h: Even more warning i missed..  

2001-10-04 13:56  androsyn

	* modules/m_accept.c, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/rsa.c,
	src/s_serv.c: Warnings related to signedness of char 

2001-10-04 13:53  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Keep Forte C from whining so much...  

2001-10-04 13:47  androsyn

	* src/: irc_string.c, linebuf.c, sprintf_irc.c: 
	Warnings..warnings..more warnings...not anymore :) 

2001-10-04 13:44  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: Accidently removed the prototype for
	strtoken()..oops 

2001-10-04 13:37  androsyn

	* include/: irc_string.h, memory.h: Cleaned up some stuff that
	generated lots of warnings on solaris 

2001-10-04 10:51  androsyn

	* BUGS: Added info about TCP resolver bug.  

2001-10-04 10:50  androsyn

	* adns/transmit.c: Disabled TCP in the resolver.  Somebody can turn
	this back on when its fixed.  

2001-10-04 09:21  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Changed the way adns rehashes.  Previously we just
	reloaded the config, but previous releases did tear down the socket.  

2001-10-04 07:52  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Okay..I *think* I've fixed that core dump..  

2001-10-04 07:25  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: That would be dns_state->nservers not nserver 

2001-10-04 07:22  androsyn

	* adns/transmit.c, src/adns.c: Three asserts that will hopefully
	track down the bug where ads->nserver == 0, which is technically not
	possible 

2001-10-03 12:16  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Well..its useful to stick in setup.h before trying
	to grab stuff autoconf defined..  

2001-10-03 12:12  androsyn

	* include/balloc.h: A misplaced define broken --disable-balloc 

2001-10-02 21:17  wcampbel

	* contrib/: m_flags.c, m_map.c: Fixed m_map.c's random failing to
	  be recognized as a command without a trailing space.  Added
	  m_flags.c, ircd-comstud like FLAGS command, completely optional
	  bloat.  It works, has been tested, and as far as I can tell, has
	  no issues.  This is slightly different than the one I posted.  It
	had the same issue as MAP did.  
	
	Anyone available to explain why these won't work sometimes with 0,
	1, 0 in the msgtab while 0, 0, 0 does.  It only appears to be that
	one combination of parameters too, as JUPE's 0, 3, 0 and NICKINFO's
	0, 2, 0 work fine.  

2001-10-02 18:31  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- reformatting this makes it understandable now.  

2001-10-02 11:23  androsyn

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y: Changed SHARED to T_SHARED as
	SHARED clashed with a #define from sys/mman.h on solaris 

2001-10-02 09:36  db

	* contrib/m_clearchan.c, contrib/m_opme.c, include/channel.h,
	modules/m_cburst.c, modules/m_cjoin.c, modules/m_drop.c,
	modules/m_invite.c, modules/m_join.c, modules/m_knock.c,
	modules/m_list.c, modules/m_lljoin.c, modules/m_topic.c,
	modules/core/m_message.c, modules/core/m_mode.c, src/channel.c,
	src/vchannel.c: 
	- After online discussion on IRC, I took the plunge. no more stupid
	  NullChn all replaced with NULL, hence all the touched files here.  

2001-10-02 09:13  db

	* include/channel.h, include/hash.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c,
	src/channel.c, src/hash.c: 
	- This takes some silliness out of m_sjoin.c 

2001-10-01 22:34  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h, include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c: 
	- Fixed the 513 vs 511 issue in the linebuf code.  

2001-10-01 20:55  db

	* tools/Makefile.in: 
	- If fixklines.c is missing in tools, it shouldn't be in Makefile 

2001-10-01 13:27  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Fixed compile for when mmap() is not there..  

2001-10-01 12:18  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c: 
	- Fix evil core that killed half the testnet, we now need to check
	  the length of remote channel names, since we use the block
	  allocator, and no longer just allocate whatever amount is required.  
	  We now send a message to opers when a SJOIN to a long channel is 
	  detected, as well as ignoring the SJOIN.  

2001-09-29 19:39  db

	* src/messages.tab: added ':' to RPL_STATSQLINE DLINE KLINE as per
	discussion with walter online, originally suggested by Chris Behrens 

2001-09-29 19:09  db

	* modules/m_rehash.c: 
	- We have no more /rehash GC, so removed that from help 

2001-09-29 19:07  a1kmm

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Fixed linebuf code so that it sets the length correctly. It now
	  works entirely with jv's converted IRCnet burst.  Approved by Diane
	on IRC.  

2001-09-29 17:27  davidt

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c, src/packet.c: 
	- More fixes for linebuf.c, this should hopefully cope with any
	  length of line properly.  

2001-09-29 16:14  db

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, src/linebuf.c: Simply
	reformatted linebuf.c a tad to agree with the rough coding standards
	of project. No electrons were harmed.  
	
	Oh yes, fixed configure script. we were over-writing an array in
	conftest.c (hidden inside config.c) nl[] declared as 4 instead of 5.
	I believe it was jv that pointed this one out to me.  

2001-09-29 16:05  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/linebuf.c, src/memory.c,
	src/packet.c, src/parse.c: 
	1) Fixed a bug where we were not properly terminating long lines
	   sent to the parser.  
	2) Fixed several bugs in linebuf_copyline where we were not
	   correctly stripping \r\n or there was a possibility of a buffer
	underflow.  
	3) Left in two of the less expensive asserts which I used to catch
	   these bugs.  Commit approved by db on IRC.  

2001-09-29 15:59  davidt

	* modules/m_challenge.c: 
	- Zero pointers after they are freed, before this commit doing 
	  /challenge foo 
	  /challenge <anything not starting with '+'> 
	  would core the ircd (where foo was a valid oper with a public key) 

2001-09-29 15:52  davidt

	* modules/core/m_nick.c, src/channel.c: 
	- Fix Count.invisi and Count.oper so they are only incremented once
	  per user.  
	- Use BlockHeapFree() not MyFree() to free bans, since they use the
	  block allocator..  

2001-09-29 07:37  wcampbel

	* src/s_debug.c: Fix for STATS r showing long values in a %d, found
	by jv, aproved by Diane 

2001-09-28 09:40  davidt

	* src/balloc.c: 
	- Change 'int zero_fd' to 'static int zero_fd' to cut down on
	  unneeded globals.  Approved by Diane on IRC.  

2001-09-27 21:33  wcampbel

	* BUGS, Hybrid-team, INSTALL, doc/operguide.txt: Updated BUGS,
	INSTALL, and Riedel's operguide.txt.  Updated numerics.txt slightly.  
	Aproval from Diane on IRC.  

2001-09-27 14:57  wcampbel

	* src/hostmask.c: Fix for STATS i/I showing restricted mode auth
	blocks as 'i' as discussed on the ircd-coders list.  

2001-09-26 12:43  leeh

	* modules/m_pong.c: 
	- unregged clients cant route ping, so they cant get routed pongs..  
	  (discussed on irc) 

2001-09-26 12:28  leeh

	* modules/m_pong.c: 
	- client_p is where we get data from, dont clear FLAGS_PINGSENT (jv) 

2001-09-26 06:51  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in,
	src/balloc.c: Added the mmap() check in autoconf that was discussed
	earlier.  Added a work around for balloc.c if mmap() isn't found.  I
	feel bad for the poor bastard who doesn't have a mmap().  

2001-09-25 21:44  androsyn

	* servlink/io.c: Eliminated a stupid compile warning when ziplinks
	and cryptlinks are disabled 

2001-09-25 19:24  androsyn

	* configure, include/setup.h.in: Please don't use autoconf 2.5x for
	hybrid.  

2001-09-25 13:42  androsyn

	* src/memory.c: Okay..so everything thinks it can pass a NULL
	pointer to MyFree()..shoot me :P 

2001-09-25 13:30  androsyn

	* src/memory.c: Would you like an assert.h 

2001-09-25 13:23  androsyn

	* include/balloc.h, include/memory.h, src/balloc.c, src/memory.c: 
	Umm..fixed some stuff :P 

2001-09-25 13:20  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Um, move this assert again. I'm sure i commited this before....  

2001-09-25 09:16  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- dont forward nicks thatdont exist in sjoin..  

2001-09-25 07:44  db

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- remove unused function 

2001-09-25 05:27  jdc

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- modules/m_stats.c: #if 0'd out stats_fd() to fix unused warning.  

2001-09-25 03:35  leeh

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- you cannot check remote servers for capabs 

2001-09-25 01:11  a1kmm

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/balloc.h,
	include/memory.h, include/setup.h.in, src/balloc.c, src/client.c,
	src/list.c, src/tools.c: 
	- Fixed up a few more things with configure.  
	- Made some assumptions which should always be valid to optimise
	  linked lists.  
	- Rewrote the block allocator with a better algorithm.  

2001-09-24 22:22  db

	* modules/m_stats.c, src/fdlist.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c: 
	- removed an unnecessary call in m_stats.c, call fd_dump() directly 
	  instead of confusing things. (for stats f) 
	
	
	- reworked s_bsd_kqueue.c to use EV_SET() macro. This ensures 
	   all kevent struct members are properly initialized at all times.  
	
	- removed NOTE_LOWAT kludge, this is not necessary if kevent struct 
	  is initialized properly as in above.  
	
	- added and remvoved fd_dump_debug() call.  
	
	- do not bother closing fd's 0,1,2,3 hey if they are in use, ircd 
	  can't use them. 4 ignored fd's aint going to hurt ircd. As it
	  turns out fd 3 is typically used for profiler, which caused CPU to
	  hit 100% as kqueue thought fd 3 was closed (which it was) since
	  profiler thought it was open, but ircd had closed it. ugh. such a
	lose.  

2001-09-24 11:06  leeh

	* src/parse.c: 
	- added ID checks to parse() 

2001-09-24 10:43  leeh

	* src/s_bsd_kqueue.c: 
	- missing ;, preume the break; was meant to be return; ? ;) 

2001-09-24 07:31  jdc

	* src/s_bsd_kqueue.c: 
	- src/s_bsd_kqueue: Error checking on some kevent() calls.  ktrace
	  is your friend.  

2001-09-24 05:00  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- Fixes for Andrew's recent configure additions.  

2001-09-24 04:13  a1kmm

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/balloc.h, include/memory.h, include/setup.h.in,

	src/ircd.c, src/ircd_parser.y, src/list.c, src/listener.c,
	src/memory.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Some memset calls added.  
	- A few more configure options added: 
	   --enable-profile - makes a profile build.  
	   --enable-efence - makes an ElectricFence build.  
	   --enable-memdebug - make a memory debugging build.  
	   --disable-block-alloc - makes a build without the balloc so
	                           buffer overruns always show up under efence.  

2001-09-23 16:54  a1kmm

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/irc_string.h,
	include/setup.h.in, modules/Makefile.in, src/memory.c: 
	- Fixed a _MyRealloc debug version bug.  
	- Kludged the strncpy_irc for now so it doesn't core(someone please
	fix!) 
	- Fixed the depend system for modules so it actually works with both 
	  static and shared modules.  

2001-09-23 15:35  a1kmm

	* include/memory.h, src/memory.c: 
	- Changing a #ifdef to a #undef is not a smart way to disable
	something.  

2001-09-23 15:33  a1kmm

	* include/memory.h, src/memory.c: 
	- Fixed a possible NULL deref I did ages ago in the debug version of 
	  MyRealloc 

2001-09-23 14:38  davidt

	* src/list.c: 
	- erp, un break compile 

2001-09-23 09:39  davidt

	* src/list.c: 
	- Move assert(t) above t->refcount = 1; 
	- Make assert()s in list.c slightly more informative.  

2001-09-23 02:35  leeh

	* modules/m_cjoin.c: 
	- dont send ids in cjoin (see email)

	* include/balloc.h, include/memory.h, modules/m_dmem.c,
	src/balloc.c, src/class.c, src/ircd_parser.y, src/list.c,
	src/memory.c: 
	- Got memory debugging going. There seems to be a few leaks already,
	  which I will fix soon. There also seems to be a core somewhere when
	  I link with efence that I need to fix.  
	- Added "dmem x" option to command to write memory log to a file.  

2001-09-22 21:50  a1kmm

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Initialise refcount on linebufs to 0. That should account for the
	  following from the profile and hopefully improve performance a bit,
	  as well as drastically reduce leaked memory.

	* modules/m_accept.c, modules/m_away.c, modules/m_cjoin.c,
	modules/m_gline.c, modules/core/m_part.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- We need to do lots more work on UIDs, but this is a start.  
	- I think we will have to leave SJOIN until after the release
	  because it needs a major rewrite. Unfortunately, as it is now, it
	  just forwards UIDs or NICKs to all servers as it receives them,
	  which will break non-UID servers. We can't change it easily though,
	  because if we substitute them it might overflow the buffer unless we
	  are prepared to split 1 SJOIN message into 2. Too risky to do at
	this stage.  

2001-09-21 10:53  leeh

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- missing U 

2001-09-20 20:29  wcampbel

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: dnl is not REALLY legal in m4
	files...gnu m4 seems to accept it but others may not.  

2001-09-20 13:10  jdc

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: 
	- contrib/m_jupe.c: Cosmetical change ("Juped:" --> "JUPED:").  

2001-09-19 17:21  lusky

	* servlink/Makefile.in: pass CFLAGS during linking too 

2001-09-19 11:08  androsyn

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_user.c: Fixed the 0::1 stuff for IPv6 support
	and removed stupid check as well.  

2001-09-18 20:19  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_parser.y, src/kdparse.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- 3 line functions are silly, so removed one.  

2001-09-18 14:57  davidt

	* include/event.h, src/event.c, src/send.c: 
	- Fix src/send.c to send the correct data to io_debug 
	- Add eventDelete to event.c, prototype to event.h 

2001-09-18 06:33  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- yet more cleanups. Its still a cesspool.  
	  no more attach_cn_lines its now attach_connect_block 

2001-09-18 06:02  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/s_conf.c: 
	- some cleanups to s_conf.c, no more attach_Iline vs. attach_iline 
	  (happy now jer?) IMO s_conf.c is still a cesspool.  

2001-09-18 01:15  jdc

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/listener.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	* src/s_conf.c: Check for lack-of serverinfo {} description field in 
	  configuration file.  Error out if conf lacks one.  
	* Many cosmetical changes (I got bored).  
	
	NOTE TO CODERS:  We should rename the "attach_iline" and
	"attach_Iline" functions soon.  Two function names which are
	identical except for case is not a good thing.  Look in s_conf.c for
	more info.  

2001-09-16 20:18  jdc

	* src/listener.c: 
	* src/listener.c: Fix for Hwy101's problems relating to IPv6 and
	  FreeBSD.  This _WILL_ break IPv6 support for Linux.  Linux-ers,
	  please look around line 379.  

2001-09-16 14:40  davidt

	* contrib/m_map.c: 
	- Tidy up m_map.c slightly, and add missing RPL_MAPEND.  

2001-09-13 08:32  habeeb

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: Fix for Lee's patch to m_nick.c, ms_nick
	didn't check whether it was a new nick (parc = 9) or a nick change
	(parc = 3) and when a nick change happened it tried to check the
	user/host which used the arguments parv[5] and parv[6].  

2001-09-12 17:19  habeeb

	* src/event.c: more changes to event code.  Fixed eventNewTime and
	a few other things.  

2001-09-12 11:00  leeh

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- only kill long usernames/hostnames, warn about erroneous ones 

2001-09-12 10:00  leeh

	* include/client.h, modules/core/m_nick.c, src/client.c: 
	- added checks for bad usernames/hostnames too..  
	  we cant just chop them off at hostlen, else you have a different
	  host across the network..  

2001-09-11 23:24  db

	* modules/m_rehash.c, src/event.c: 
	- minor cleanups 

2001-09-11 22:42  habeeb

	* modules/: m_rehash.c, core/m_server.c: you might need those 2
	files updated also.  

2001-09-11 22:39  habeeb

	* include/event.h: for previous commit..  

2001-09-11 22:39  habeeb

	* src/: adns.c, channel.c, client.c, event.c, ircd.c, linebuf.c,
	s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_conf.c, s_gline.c, s_log.c, s_serv.c: This
	changes event to a static table.  It is not complete so please
	finish: *Add eventDelete code that will basically set the active
	flag to 0 *impliment active flag *fix eventNextTime ; need to add a
	variable to store next time.  *check line 593 in src/s_serv.c i
	 commented it, need to set the event inactive if the if() is true 
	
	This should be all for now;  If I missed anything I will update
	this.  

2001-09-11 22:09  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- corrected tiny typo. Our table size is still too large for yacc 
	  We are going to have to require bison.  

2001-09-11 18:01  db

	* include/event.h, include/s_serv.h, src/event.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_serv.c: 
	- first pass at making events static and recurring instead of
	  one-shot.  This saves a malloc each time an event is added and the
	  need to re-add an event each time. The default is recurring for
	static events.  
	
	- ripped expr out of ircd_parser.y Sorry Edward, but tired of byacc
	  coring all the time and its not really needed.  

2001-09-11 11:49  jdc

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- Removed "hide_server" command; use serverhide {} instead.  

2001-09-11 11:47  leeh

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- missing | 

2001-09-10 09:28  davidt

	* src/packet.c: 
	- We could occasionally fail to notice we hadn't read the correct
	  amount of data for a servlink command, due to a missing return;.  

2001-09-08 18:41  androsyn

	* src/s_auth.c: Resolved the stupid ::1 issue. So we are doing 0::1
	now. This is ugly..but it works and is still a legal IPv6 address.  

2001-09-08 08:27  androsyn

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, src/irc_string.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c: 
	Adds a dot_in_ip6_addr option in general {} 
	
	Also..only add the . on to sockhost.  Oh..and I just broke ::1 stuff
	again so that it will get fixed in the next 50 years.  

2001-09-06 15:46  leeh

	* src/match.c: 
	- . is an acceptable ident char 

2001-09-06 05:34  leeh

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- updated links_delay description to say how it actually works 

2001-09-06 04:34  leeh

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/ircd.c, src/ircdauth.c, src/listener.c,
	src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- added oper/admin flags to report_error() 
	  untested as im not sure how to get one of these to trigger ;p 

2001-09-05 15:03  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c, contrib/m_map.c: 
	- Fix linebuf.c/linebuf_putmsg to correctly "\r\n\0" terminate
	  extra-long lines, instead of "\0\r\n\0" terminating them, which
	  tickles yet another BitchX bug. '\0' bad.  
	- Include s_conf.h in m_map.c so it at least compiles.  

2001-09-05 05:14  leeh

	* contrib/Makefile.in, contrib/spy_admin_notice.c,
	contrib/spy_info_notice.c, contrib/spy_links_notice.c,
	contrib/spy_motd_notice.c, contrib/spy_stats_notice.c,

	include/hook.h, modules/m_admin.c, modules/m_info.c,

	- moved the rest of the FLAGS_SPY stuff to contrib/ 

2001-09-05 04:14  leeh

	* contrib/Makefile.in: 
	- *_notice.c -> spy_*_notice.c 

2001-09-05 04:06  leeh

	* messages/build_one: 
	- added checks for Makefile to build_one 

2001-09-04 11:00  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- updated it to cover cryptlinks..  
	- added it to example.conf 

2001-09-04 09:53  leeh

	* include/client.h, include/s_serv.h, modules/core/m_server.c,
	src/client.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- initial revision of th ehide server stuff 

2001-09-04 07:25  leeh

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_conf.c: 
	- added two new conf options for shide.. hidden and allow_hidden 

2001-09-04 05:26  leeh

	* modules/m_version.c: 
	- changed the strcat()'s for the config info to pointers..  

2001-09-02 18:56  wcampbel

	* BUGS: Updated the BUGS list a wee bit 

2001-08-31 11:04  habeeb

	* src/event.c: Small bug fix in eventAdd() 

2001-08-31 07:02  leeh

	* contrib/spy_stats_notice.c, include/hook.h, modules/m_stats.c,
	modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- removed some debug stuff from write_links_file() 
	- changed stats notice back to a letter.. else you can get some
	  "original" notices to give to opers..  

2001-08-31 06:16  leeh

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- fixed the stats spy stuff 

2001-08-31 05:59  leeh

	* src/modules.c: 
	- modlist/modrestart dont require params, modrestart doesnt take
	  them, theyre optional in modlist 

2001-08-31 05:54  leeh

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- updated example.conf 

2001-08-31 05:48  leeh

	* contrib/m_map.c, include/channel.h, include/ircd.h,
	include/s_conf.h, modules/m_admin.c, modules/m_info.c,
	modules/m_links.c, modules/m_lusers.c, modules/m_motd.c,

	modules/core/m_server.c, src/client.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/parse.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- gave serverhide its own config block :P 

2001-08-30 10:38  davidt

	* src/: client.c, s_serv.c, send.c: 
	- Attempt to flush sendq of exiting clients 
	- When flushing a sendq, attempt to flush as many lines as possible,
	  instead of one line per call of send_queued_write.  
	- Close fds 0/1/2 for slink process on non solaris platforms.  
	- Zero localClient after allocating it.  

2001-08-30 03:45  leeh

	* modules/m_motd.c, src/motd.c: 
	- allow unregged clients to see the motd, but then drop them.  
	
	  this doesnt actually work atm: 
	      MOTD 
	      :mafia.leeh.co.uk 375 * :- mafia.leeh.co.uk Message of the Day
	      - Connection closed by foreign host.  
	
	  we disconnect the client before we send them the full motd, we
	  should dump a users queue to them, then boot them 

2001-08-29 08:29  leeh

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- reverted the linebuf changes, they caused more problems than they
	fixed 

2001-08-29 08:14  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, modules/m_stats.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- added stats_P_oper_only 

2001-08-28 09:41  wcampbel

	* messages/build_one: Added two scripts, one to build a single
	module in contrib based upon what is present in the Makefile,
	another to build a single message file.  Both depend on a sucessful
	configure run.  
	
	They are not perfect, but they work on my system.  

2001-08-28 08:23  wcampbel

	* doc/: index.txt, technical/index.txt: Completed the
	repo-move/reorganization of the doc tree, updated the index files.  

2001-08-27 18:54  wcampbel

	* tools/mkpasswd.c: Synced up mkpasswd 

2001-08-26 18:20  db

	* src/event.c: 
	- There was a bug in eventAdd which could lead to an infinite loop.  
	  I rewrote eventAdd and eventDelete. They actually look sane now.  

2001-08-26 17:40  androsyn

	* modules/m_stats.c: localtime and strftime need time.h 

2001-08-26 15:24  kreator

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y, tools/convertconf.c: 
	- misc formatting fixes for example.conf 
	- check if ServerInfo.max_clients is bigger than MAX_CLIENTS which
	  would cause fdtable[] initialisation to core 
	- update convertconf a bit 

2001-08-26 14:08  habeeb

	* src/linebuf.c: Fix for linebuf parsing problem that apparently
	broke ZIPLINKS.  

2001-08-26 11:09  davidt

	* include/s_serv.h, modules/m_stats.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- Tweak /stats Z slightly to be more useful, and handle overflows
	gracefully 

2001-08-26 08:26  davidt

	* src/hook.c: 
	- Forgot to commit these changes when I added the hooks for
	m_iodebug.c 

2001-08-25 21:31  wcampbel

	* BUGS, Hybrid-team, README.FIRST, RELNOTES, TODO, contrib/README,
	doc/index.txt, doc/messages.txt, include/defaults.h, tools/README: 
	1. Numerous doc cleanups (spelling, obsolete things, efnow.net
	   references, missing files, files that have been removed) 
	2. Updated my TODO list some more 
	3. Synced up the defaults in include/defaults.h to the ones we
	   discussed with ievil back in the early 6.1 days 
	4. Added doc/messages.txt, a user and admin document on using and
	   creating custom message files 

2001-08-25 21:05  db

	* contrib/m_map.c, include/numeric.h, src/messages.tab: 
	- added jv's mods I locally added numerics for the map function 

2001-08-25 19:41  wcampbel

	* TODO: Updated a good portion of TODO 

2001-08-25 09:22  db

	* include/client.h, include/hash.h, modules/m_accept.c,
	modules/m_lljoin.c, modules/m_llnick.c, modules/m_pong.c,
	modules/m_trace.c, modules/m_whois.c, modules/core/m_kill.c,
	modules/core/m_nick.c, src/client.c, src/hash.c, src/vchannel.c: 
	- renamed hash_find_client() to find_client() in hash.c 
	  find_client() in client.c was simply calling hash_find_client()
	  anyway.  

2001-08-25 09:04  wcampbel

	* contrib/m_mkpasswd.c: This is an updated m_mkpasswd.c, allowing
	you to use a second parameter to specify which password hashing
	algorithm to use, DES or MD5.  

2001-08-25 02:15  a1kmm

	* src/client.c: 
	- Fixed the core on JUPE bug, we cannot remove capabs when a juped
	  server exits if we never set them for that server.  

2001-08-25 01:22  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h: 
	- I can't get RESV to core as fl seemed to think it did with
	  USE_CHANNEL_MODE before. We really need to get this stable so we can
	  get an rc out soon, so I am enabling it so we can pick up any bugs
	  in it sooner rather than later. I suspect that USE_CHANNEL_MODE will
	  be more important on efnet than the RESV as it fixes problems with
	  conflicts between hybrid-7 which has only one of ohv at the same
	  time and other servers, so if we can't fix it we should probably
	disable RESV.  

2001-08-25 00:41  a1kmm

	* include/irc_string.h, src/hostmask.c: 
	- Hopefully this will fix most of the hostmask.c problems we have
	  been experiencing. I am not entirely sure the IPv6 code is right but
	  it is better than it was.  

2001-08-24 22:25  wcampbel

	* contrib/: Makefile.in, README, m_mkpasswd.c: Added a basic
	m_mkpasswd module to contrib, this generates DES passwords only, and
	you cannot specify a salt.  This is also at present available to
	regular users, and paced.  Please provide a valid reason before
	removing support for regular users.  

2001-08-24 16:53  davidt

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/hook.h, src/linebuf.c,
	src/packet.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/send.c: 
	- Fix configure[.in] so --enable-assert/--disable-assert do what
	  they claim, not the opposite.  
	- Add hooks for m_iodebug.so, to allow dumping the raw IO to a
	  logfile using m_iodebug.c (not committed, since it could also be
	  used for slightly different reasons...) 

2001-08-24 09:27  leeh

	* src/motd.c: 
	- commented out the no oper motd line.. if they dont see one, there
	  isnt one.. seems kinda obvious surely? :) 

2001-08-24 08:31  leeh

	* include/s_misc.h, include/s_serv.h, include/s_user.h,
	modules/m_stats.c, src/s_misc.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- more of em.. I cant even remember which this time :P 

2001-08-24 06:58  leeh

	* include/s_gline.h, modules/m_stats.c, src/s_gline.c: 
	- moved report_glines() to m_stats.c 

2001-08-24 05:14  leeh

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_stats.c, src/hostmask.c: 
	- moved report_dlines and report_elines -> m_stats.c and merged them
	  with the stats function that called them 

2001-08-24 04:52  leeh

	* modules/m_join.c: 
	- dumped build_list_of_channels, theres no point remaking the
	  buffer, with the possibility that we will ignore half of the new
	buffer anyway 
	
	  I havent dropped the strtoken()'s yet.. possibly later :) 

2001-08-23 15:41  davidt

	* doc/technical/cryptlink.txt: Add Id tag 

2001-08-23 15:30  davidt

	* src/parse.c: 
	- Fix string_to_array so that we correctly handle the weirdness of
	  empty params, etc.  I think this is right, but it's hard to test on
	  a network with at least 3 different versions of parse.c running on
	it..  

2001-08-23 00:03  db

	* modules/m_join.c: 
	- I couldn't take it anymore. cleaned up build_list_of_channels
	slightly 
	- started preliminary code for JOIN TS from remote server.  

2001-08-22 14:44  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, doc/modes.txt, doc/whats-new.txt,
	include/client.h, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- removed +e and stuck gecos on the end of the +c notice 

2001-08-22 13:24  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- added back the second buffer, this time it actually does something
	  and is less complex 

2001-08-22 08:01  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- theres no need to make two sjoin bufs at all, especially when
	  theyre *identical* and one of them isnt even done properly..  

2001-08-22 06:59  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- setting a pointer to p, which is null, then checking if its \0 is
	bad.  

2001-08-22 06:48  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- added check for trailing spaces..  

2001-08-22 06:41  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- cleanups 

2001-08-22 06:29  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- *p = '\0'; 
	  p++; 
	  -> *p++ ='\0'; 

2001-08-22 05:39  leeh

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- fixed sjoin.. I commented most of it 
	  someone should probably review this :) 

2001-08-21 22:06  androsyn

	* src/parse.c: Okay so strspn() wasn't such a great idea...  

2001-08-21 21:39  androsyn

	* src/parse.c: Changed the arguments and make string_to_array work
	right 

2001-08-21 21:03  androsyn

	* src/parse.c: This has a hopefully faster version of
	string_to_array() 

2001-08-21 15:56  leeh

	* include/config.h: 
	- drop defaults down low so it will run first time 

2001-08-21 15:50  leeh

	* contrib/m_opme.c: 
	- remove modded files before you commit ;) 

2001-08-21 15:11  davidt

	* contrib/m_opme.c, doc/example.conf, include/config.h,
	src/linebuf.c, src/send.c: 
	- Oops, fix a couple tiny bugs in the new linebuf_putmsg code that
	  caused some major problems truncating various bits of messages.  

2001-08-21 14:16  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Ahem, 'make install' is needed for testing, 'make' doesn't help
	  much.  Anyway, now that I'm testing the actual changes, this _does_
	  help improve burst times (on a hub, that needs to relay the burst
	  elsewhere) by up to 12.5% (this was measured on a
	  localhost->localhost burst, if there's a bandwidth bottleneck, the
	  bandwidth will probably be the major bottleneck anyway).

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c, src/packet.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/send.c: 
	- Create linebuf_putmsg, which essentially replaces linebuf_put,
	  since we no longer use linebuf_put anywhere.  This get rids of a few
	  needless copies of outgoing messages per call of sendto_* functions.  
	- Unfortunately, we now use snprintf/vsnprintf, not ircsprintf,
	  since there is no irc[v]snprintf function available.  Not sure how
	  badly this affect things, but if it's bad, make a ircvsnprintf
	function...  
	- Tidy a few warnings in --disable-assert mode.  

2001-08-21 11:59  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- Clean up m_sjoin.c slightly.  

2001-08-21 11:51  androsyn

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/linebuf.c: Diane's optimizations of
	the SJOIN code and some of the linebuf code.  

2001-08-20 20:19  androsyn

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: Kill one memset() 

2001-08-20 20:06  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/irc_string.h,
	include/setup.h.in, src/irc_string.c: Check for strtok_r()...if it
	exists, use it instead of strtoken().  If strtok_r is found, we
	define a macro to call strtok_r() instead...  

2001-08-20 18:31  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- a little more cleanup 

2001-08-20 16:32  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- changed temp in report_Klines to k_or_K 

2001-08-20 16:30  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- re idented to conform with project standards.  
	- removed unnecessary strncat, replaced with strncpy() 

2001-08-20 13:41  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: This is a hack to make poll() use a single
	list. This isn't the right way to do it, but it will do for now.  

2001-08-20 12:00  androsyn

	* src/linebuf.c: I think this fix is right for linebuf_copy_line()
	please look at it as it could probably still use work.  

2001-08-19 16:30  leeh

	* modules/m_list.c: 
	- not pacing a possible 50k channel list between a HUB <-> LL is
	  slightly evil..  

2001-08-19 16:12  leeh

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- removed an unneeded variable 

2001-08-18 10:37  davidt

	* TODO, contrib/Makefile.in, contrib/m_map.c: 
	- Add m_map.c to contrib/, since it was in TODO and I was bored.  

2001-08-18 05:55  leeh

	* TODO, doc/Makefile.in, doc/dline.conf, doc/resv.txt: 
	- doc updates 
	- added a blank dline.conf 
	  (should we just use touch instead?) 

2001-08-17 17:58  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- Flipped order of CFLAGS addition (at the end, not at the
	beginning).  

2001-08-17 17:54  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, contrib/Makefile.in,
	doc/Makefile.in, iauth/Makefile.in, iauth/source/Makefile.in,
	modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	- Many fixes for CFLAGS variable support.  
	- Fixed  --enable-assert and  --disable-assert.  
	- Cosmetical changes all over (formatting issues).  

2001-08-17 15:03  davidt

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	- Instead of polling SERVICES,SERVERS,/*BUSYCLIENTS*/,IDLECLIENTS,
	  and delaying on IDLECLIENTS (which means we _should_ always delay
	  for the full x ms, if they are really idle clients), do it in
	  reverse: poll IDLECLIENTS, /*BUSYCLIENTS*/, SERVICES, then delay on
	  SERVERS, so we delay on (presumably) the busiest links, and we'll
	  wake up if anything happens.  
	  I fail to see how the multi-list stuff really helps us...  

2001-08-16 23:39  androsyn

	* src/: channel.c, linebuf.c: Changed a few eventAdd()'s to
	eventAddIsh() which keeps some of the events from running all at
	once.  We should look into making some of the events do this.  

2001-08-16 22:21  androsyn

	* src/linebuf.c: Oops..an off by one error..  

2001-08-16 22:17  androsyn

	* src/linebuf.c: Its helpful if you update the length of the
	bufhead as well as the bufline 

2001-08-16 20:10  androsyn

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/ircd.c: Added
	block heap allocation for struct Channel.  This ends up enabling us
	to return most all of the memory allocated while servers are joined
	back to the OS.  

2001-08-16 19:45  androsyn

	* src/linebuf.c: Yet another swing at this. This time we use
	memcpy().  

2001-08-16 17:19  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Of course, it didn't work, but this does.  

2001-08-16 17:16  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Commit fixed version of improved linebuf_copy_line.  
	  This _should_ work. I hope.  

2001-08-16 13:20  leeh

	* include/client.h: 
	- missed this one 

2001-08-16 13:19  leeh

	* include/ircd.h, modules/m_links.c, modules/core/m_server.c,
	src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- GlobalServList (used pointers in struct Client) to dlink_list 
	  global_serv_list (dbd) 

2001-08-16 07:26  androsyn

	* src/linebuf.c: Minor little change that should speed things up a
	tiny bit..  

2001-08-16 06:53  androsyn

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c, src/packet.c: Removed the
	binary flag from linebuf_copy_line(). First we are not doing 
	ziplinks within ircd, second, the ziplink code never actually
	generates a \r or \n, so this code was likely a mute point in the
	first place.  

2001-08-15 07:48  leeh

	* doc/modeg.txt: 
	- updated the docs to cover the multi accept system 

2001-08-15 07:43  androsyn

	* include/list.h: Missing prototype for init_dlink_nodes() or
	whatever the function is called :) 

2001-08-14 15:58  davidt

	* src/modules.c: 
	- Use free_dlink_node(node) not MyFree(node), since node is from
	  balloc, and is inside a chunk of memory from mmap, not something
	free()able.  

2001-08-14 10:44  db

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- removed unused variable, since we are back to using a block
	allocator 

2001-08-13 19:00  leeh

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- missing ; 

2001-08-13 14:44  leeh

	* include/client.h, include/numeric.h, messages/ayb.po,
	messages/custom.po, messages/translations/ircd-croatian.po,
	messages/translations/ircd-danish.po,
	messages/translations/ircd-dutch.po,
	messages/translations/ircd-german.po,

	messages/translations/ircd-spanish.po,
	messages/translations/ircd-swedish.po, modules/m_accept.c,
	src/client.c, src/messages.tab: 
	- updated the accept stuff: 
	   - add_accept() is now in m_accept.c 
	   - list_accepts() is now in m_accept.c 
	
	   - added five new numerics: 
	      281 RPL_ACCEPTLIST - accept list 
	      282 RPL_ENDOFACCEPT - end of accept list 
	
	      456 ERR_ACCEPTFULL - full accept list 
	      457 ERR_ACCEPTEXIST - trying to add a client already on their
	      list 458 ERR_ACCEPTNOT - removing a client not on their list 

2001-08-13 13:56  androsyn

	* src/: ircd.c, linebuf.c, list.c: make_dlink_node now uses the
	block heap again..  

2001-08-13 13:14  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Put memset() back for struct Client allocations..  

2001-08-13 12:17  jdc

	* modules/m_cryptlink.c: 
	- modules/m_cryptlink.c: Call verify_private_key() before
	MyMalloc().  

2001-08-13 11:16  androsyn

	* src/s_serv.c: It is useful to set a fd_note() on a non cryptlink
	server.  

2001-08-13 10:45  androsyn

	* include/list.h, src/ircd.c, src/list.c: Block heap for struct
	User now..  

2001-08-13 09:51  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Getting pages via /dev/zero actually compiles and
	works now.  

2001-08-13 09:44  androsyn

	* include/balloc.h, src/balloc.c, src/ircd.c: Added support for
	getting anonymous pages via the /dev/zero method 

2001-08-13 08:27  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: That should be balloc.h 

2001-08-13 07:20  androsyn

	* src/: balloc.c, client.c, linebuf.c: Removed memset() from
	BlockHeapAlloc() it is up to the caller to do the init of its block.  

2001-08-13 04:26  leeh

	* messages/translations/ircd-croatian.po: 
	- commited Vid Strpic's update of the croatian language file 

2001-08-12 22:25  androsyn

	* src/balloc.c: Make sure the garbage collector doesn't remove the
	root block.  

2001-08-12 22:09  androsyn

	* include/balloc.h, src/Makefile.in, src/balloc.c, src/client.c,
	src/linebuf.c: Okay..second attempt at this commit..  

2001-08-12 21:48  androsyn

	* include/memory.h, src/Makefile.in, src/client.c, src/linebuf.c: 
	Brought back the block heap allocator, with improvments.  Added
	support in client.c and linebuf.c 

2001-08-12 09:32  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_conf.c: 
	- removed traces of no_hack_ops as its not optional anymore 

2001-08-11 13:42  leeh

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- you cant use a hash table lookup for incoming servers, else you
	  can have *.com on one side of the net, and x.com on the other.  
	
	  you have to use two match()'s 

2001-08-10 04:25  leeh

	* modules/m_version.c: 
	- I agree with Hwy, we should block remote versions at all, mainly 
	  because you know the first server to reply to the request, if its
	  not the target is a hub.. which would make hub hiding useless.. :) 

2001-08-07 20:03  leeh

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	- commited dabulldogs patch: 
	  slight idiot proofing.. will move the modules dir to modules-old,
	  then install in modules/ 

2001-08-07 04:54  leeh

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- when you get server exists, you cannot exit the duplicate, you
	  have to drop your uplink, else you cause *massive* problems 

2001-08-06 19:35  leeh

	* src/parse.c: 
	- attempting to use things from a null struct is bad (jv) 

2001-08-06 00:36  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- missing set of last_ptr. oops.  

2001-08-06 00:03  ejb

	* include/irc_string.h, modules/descrip.mms, src/descrip.mms,
	src/irc_string.c, src/version.com: 
	- fixed VMS support; appears to work (compile + link) 

2001-08-05 23:18  ejb

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- well, it seems BSD yacc no longer dump core when we uncomment 
	  negative number support in the parser, so enable it.  

2001-08-05 13:42  db

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	- uhmm an int is not a string. repeat after me. an int is not a
	  string.  changed %s to %d 

2001-08-05 11:01  leeh

	* include/channel.h: 
	- undef'd use_table_mode.  
	
	  Do NOT redefine this without first talking to diane.  Ill email my 
	  backtrace to the list when it comes back online, we will probably
	  beta tonight, and the table code has cores.  
	
	  Do not reenable this, the rest of the coders are in agreement about
	  this 

2001-08-05 03:42  leeh

	* include/client.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- made hybrid7 TS5 

2001-08-05 00:22  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: 
	- Send "*" on -k, this should fix the key problems with the
	  USE_TABLE_MODE code. We really shouldn't enable the old code,
	  because it has issues with many things such as wrong compatibility
	  with clients/servers which support more than one of +o/+v/+h. I am
	  tempted to get rid of the previous code altogether.  
	- I can't reproduce fl's reported core on unjupe with the new code,
	  so a bt would be good.  

2001-08-04 08:35  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, src/channel.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- added ConfigChannel.persist time to determine the minimum length
	  of time a channel will remain when its last user quits from it 
	
	  Its minimum, because it will exist until the next cleanup_channels() 

2001-08-04 07:56  wcampbel

	* doc/server-version-info: Updated server-version-info from Lee's
	changes last night 

2001-08-04 06:13  leeh

	* modules/m_info.c, modules/m_version.c, src/s_debug.c: 
	- updated info 
	- updated letters in /version 

2001-08-04 04:40  leeh

	* contrib/spy_whois_notice.c, modules/m_whois.c: 
	- minor cleanups 

2001-08-04 04:26  leeh

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: 
	- updated jupe to take account of the GloalServerList 

2001-08-03 07:14  leeh

	* include/channel.h: 
	- undeffed USE_TABLE_MODE, theres a bug in chcap stuff which will
	  core when removing jupes 

2001-08-03 06:10  leeh

	* contrib/m_jupe.c, contrib/spy_links_notice.c,
	contrib/spy_stats_notice.c, include/client.h, include/send.h,

	src/s_conf.c, src/s_debug.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c,
	src/send.c: 
	- added a new param to sendto_realops_flags() 
	  this is an indication of what level the opers need: 
	    L_ALL: opers and admins 
	    L_OPER: opers who arent admins 
	    L_ADMIN: admins only 

2001-08-02 23:30  spookey

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	 - show /who user when user is +i  ..  thanks poptix 

2001-08-02 10:29  leeh

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	- changed report_error -> sendto_realops_flags() 
	  allows us to show IP to admins, not to opers..  
	
	  adding an ilog() for read errors.  

2001-07-31 02:30  leeh

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- added cryptlinks to stats c 

2001-07-29 13:06  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- allow -ovh from servers 

2001-07-28 18:51  leeh

	* src/: client.c, ircd.c, s_serv.c: 
	- make it compile with USE_TABLE_MODE #undef'd 

2001-07-28 15:55  wcampbel

	* tools/mkpasswd.c: Updated the mkpasswd.c program, forgot about
	this one 

2001-07-28 15:51  wcampbel

	* tools/README.mkpasswd: Updated the docs for mkpasswd.c 

2001-07-28 03:47  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/s_serv.c: 
	- Fixed the table mode code.  

2001-07-27 12:55  leeh

	* include/channel.h: 
	- #undef'd USE_TABLE_CODE 
	  this is *fucked*.  

2001-07-27 12:34  androsyn

	* src/channel.c: This ain't the right fix..but this thing needs
	rewritten..badly..  

2001-07-27 09:45  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- added numerous comments to explain the new code..  

2001-07-27 09:39  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- coding when tired is bad..  

2001-07-27 05:14  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- sendto_one() doesnt care about LL, so we need to check manually..  

2001-07-27 04:27  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- I am fl_! breaker of cvs! 

2001-07-27 03:26  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- make sure there IS a capab, before you check IsCapable 

2001-07-26 13:01  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- fix the +eI cap business 
	  we now loop the serv_list in send_cap_mode_changes, stringing
	  modebufs as we go..  

2001-07-26 08:52  leeh

	* modules/core/: m_server.c, m_squit.c: 
	- someone had used client_p->host instead of client_p->name in
	  m_squit.c, meaning when a server squit their uplink, their host got
	  broadcast ugh 
	
	- made the links file use GlobalServerList 

2001-07-26 08:31  leeh

	* modules/m_links.c: 
	- make links use GlobalServerList 

2001-07-26 08:23  leeh

	* include/client.h, include/ircd.h, include/s_serv.h,
	modules/core/m_server.c, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- added GlobalServerList 
	  this will allow a better way to loop for servers, than looping 
	  50k clients to do a /links list :P 

2001-07-25 14:23  leeh

	* modules/m_pong.c: 
	- an unregged client should never get a remote ping.. therefore 
	  it should never need to be routed 
	- changed an irccmp() to a !match() 

2001-07-24 17:50  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- added a catcher for those who dont bother reading the config
	  files, will exit() the ircd unless its removed (its off if the lines
	not there) 

2001-07-23 17:56  leeh

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- IsAdmin != IsSetOperAdmin 
	  ugh ugh ugh! 

2001-07-23 06:48  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Changed "Remote closed the connection" to "Remote
	host closed the connection" 

2001-07-22 07:03  leeh

	* src/channel.c: 
	- only show +eI modes to chanops/halfops 

2001-07-21 13:18  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Added a
	--enable-assert/--disable-assert option.  Currently it defaults to 
	enable-assert, but this should be changed for the release.  

2001-07-20 12:35  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: I think i this should be the right way to
	do the inline stuff :) 

2001-07-20 08:30  androsyn

	* src/sprintf_irc.c: inline vsprintf_irc() for the sake of
	ircsprintf() save a single function call at least :) 

2001-07-20 08:22  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h, src/irc_string.c: Made some changes to
	strncpy_irc().  
	
	Basically on systems using gcc with -O2 set, gcc will provide its
	own builtin version of memcpy() which is far faster than
	strncpy_irc() so we set a macro to do that.  
	
	For systems not using gcc, but have inlined functions, we provide an
	inlined version of strncpy_irc().  
	
	Alas, for systems that neither use gcc or support inlined functions
	we fall back to the plain old version we've been using all the long.  

2001-07-20 07:44  androsyn

	* include/setup.h.in, autoconf/configure.in, configure: Added check
	for inlined functions..  

2001-07-20 05:45  wcampbel

	* modules/m_help.c: UHELP command added, this lets an oper view the
	user help file without deopering.  UHELP for non-opers just does a
	regular HELP for non-opers (paced) UHELP for opers is not paced.  

2001-07-20 04:28  leeh

	* include/m_info.h, src/motd.c: 
	- added UHPATH to /info 
	- needed case UHELP_MOTD: in motd.c, for a blind commit hwy, it was

	* doc/Makefile.in, include/config.h, include/motd.h,
	include/s_conf.h, modules/m_help.c, modules/m_rehash.c, src/ircd.c: 
	Add in /quote HELP for users.  doc/users.txt is the file that's sent 
	to the user.  It's also already paced, so that concern of Diane's is
	taken care of.  
	
	Someone please test this, as I don't have a server set up and
	running at the moment.  

2001-07-19 20:46  wcampbel

	* src/irc_string.c: Fix my commit from before, nameser.h is needed
	on FreeBSD 

2001-07-19 19:23  wcampbel

	* src/irc_string.c: Removed an include (arpa/nameser.h) This breaks
	Cygwin compiles, and appears to not be needed.  
	
	Someone want to check on this for me? 

2001-07-19 06:31  androsyn

	* include/ircd.h, include/setup.h.in, src/ircd.c, src/s_debug.c: 
	Fix for the broken fix of the compile warnings that I fixed
	yesterday on 64bit platforms, but ended up needing to refix on 32bit
	platforms.  
	
	The universe truly hates me :P 

2001-07-19 00:15  a1kmm

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Re-enabled the #ifdef PACE_CONNECTs 
	- Added a configuration option throttle_time = <seconds>; Set to 0
	  to disable throttling.  

2001-07-18 18:13  bill

2001-07-18 08:40  androsyn

	* BUGS: Reflected the fact that the openssl related warnings are
	fixed.  

2001-07-18 08:39  androsyn

	* include/ircd.h, modules/m_trace.c, modules/m_version.c,

	* src/: restart.c, s_debug.c, s_misc.c: Fixed some issues with
	64bit version and remove some drain bamage as well.  

2001-07-18 08:04  androsyn

	* src/rsa.c: Sorta fixed the warnings in rsa.c.  We need to figure
	out why we can't include pem.h.  

2001-07-18 07:36  androsyn

	* src/channel.c: Fixed compile warning on 64bit platforms 

2001-07-18 07:12  leeh

	* modules/: Makefile.in, core/m_nick.c: 
	- missed a 'fi' in the makefile 
	- fixed two stupid bugs: 
	  i) if a client has an id.. hes already regged, so calling 
	       client_from_server == core.  
	  ii) fixed the logic for people changing nick case 

2001-07-18 05:11  leeh

	* contrib/: Makefile.in, m_jupe.c:

2001-07-17 21:28  androsyn

	* src/s_log.c: A stray log() still needed to be converted to ilog() 

2001-07-17 21:01  leeh

	* modules/: Makefile.in, core/m_nick.c: 
	- *********** blat ************ 
	  rewrote m_nick.c to include m_client.c, seperated out all the
	  collide stuff and removed god knows how much bloat 
	
	  I now need to gocrawl into bed.  

2001-07-17 20:50  lusky

2001-07-17 14:12  leeh

	* configure: 
	- I didnt mean to do that (it explains the double commit) I saw it 
	  commiting configure and went "erp!" 
	
	  this backs out the configure change ;)

	- thats it, persistent clients are gone 
	
	  they are never gunna be workable realitically for real clients,
	  theres too much scope for abuse 
	
	  that leaves them to be an opers toy, and frankly, that just makes it 
	  bloat.  The other coders are in agreement, so theyre gone.

		* - none of above 

2001-07-16 17:26  leeh

	  stats l * needs to mask stuff too..  

2001-07-16 12:39  leeh

	* src/listener.c: 
	- server ips in stats P are admin only.  

2001-07-16 11:48  leeh

2001-07-15 21:11  spookey

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: modified
	ircd-hybrid-7/autoconf/configure.in to check properly for
	sys/event.h if kqueue is selected and to properly discard prepend
	underscore checking in shared libraries when nlist.h cannot be found 
	updated configure from autoconf/configure.in 

2001-07-15 13:52  leeh

	* include/m_info.h: 
	- added ipv6/pace_connect to /info 

2001-07-15 13:18  leeh

	* doc/example.conf:

2001-07-14 16:08  leeh

	* modules/: m_capab.c, m_cryptlink.c: 
	- dont exit clients on capab either, people will just make newbies
	  abuse it (hey! /capab will make you a god!) 
	- m_registered for cryptlink!? :)  lets just ignore it ;) 

2001-07-14 16:04  leeh

	* modules/m_cburst.c:

2001-07-08 19:00  androsyn

	* include/modules.h: Forgot the msgtab stuff in modules.h for
	static builds..  

2001-07-08 15:44  androsyn

	* src/modules.c: When adding new modules, you really need to update
	modules.c so that the having thoses modules compiled statically
	works right.  

2001-07-08 03:12  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- If we get a small TS on a non-existant channel, set the newts to
	  800000000 not 0.  

2001-07-07 20:12  a1kmm

	* include/client.h, src/client.c, src/send.c: 
	- Reverted the testsuite module stuff, it probably shouldn't be
	  committed yet.  

2001-07-07 20:00  a1kmm

	* include/client.h, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/send.c: 
	- Actually set the key/limit to 0 on -k / -l as join requires this,
	  turning off the mode flag is not enough.  
	- Adding some of the code which will eventually be used to allow a
	  test-suite module.  

2001-07-07 08:03  leeh

	* doc/: index.txt, resv.txt, whats-new.txt:

2001-07-04 06:28  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, modules/m_stats.c:

	- updated the conf to reflect resv {}; 

2001-07-04 06:05  leeh

	- wheeeeeeeeeeeee :) 
	
	  added support for wildcard nick resv's 
	  this means two seperate structs.. channels are in the hash for
	  speed reasons.. but we have to search through a linked list of

2001-07-03 06:32  leeh

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y, s_conf.c:

	  resv { 
	    reason="no services on this network"; 
	    nick="chanserv"; 
	    nick="nickserv"; 
	    channel="#services";

	  you can still list them by doing stats Q

	* include/resv.h, include/s_conf.h, modules/m_resv.c,

	  the beginning of the reply tho :P

	modules/m_capab.c, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/modules.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: Monster Update(tm) time.
	Please read the following disclaimer: 
	
	Cryptlinks have been slightly redone in a different format: THE
	PROTOCOL HAS CHANGED.  You will *NOT* be able to connect an older
	hybrid-7 daemon with this and future versions of hybrid-7.  The same
	goes for present hybrid-6 connecting to this hybrid-7 or vice-versa.
	The result of trying to connect older daemons will be a timeout, or
	otherwise odd behaviour.  
	
	- doc/cryptlink.txt 
	    * Updated the protocol; should be cleaner, handled under one
	      command: CRYPTLINK.  Subset commands are AUTH and SERV (eg.
	      CRYPTLINK AUTH, and CRYPTLINK SERV).  
	    * Error handling is now documented.  
	    * Examples of protocol transactions.  
	
	- doc/example.conf 
	    * Updated comments regarding how to use "cipher_preference" and 
	      "default_cipher_preference" directives.  
	
	- include/client.h 
	    * Cosmetical changes.  
	
	- include/defaults.h 
	    * Cosmetical changes.  
	
	- include/modules.h 
	- src/modules.c 
	    * Removed "cryptauth_msgtab" and "cryptserv_msgtab" defs.  
	    * Added "cryptlink_msgtab" extern declaration.  
	
	- include/s_conf.h 
	- src/s_conf.c 
	    * Changed "cipher_preference" and "default_cipher_preference"
	      defs from from EncPreference to EncCapability.  
	
	- include/s_serv.h 
	- src/s_serv.c 
	    * Removed EncPreference structure.  
	    * Renamed "enccaptab" to "CipherTable".  
	    * Changed cryptlink_error() function to take a lot more
	      arguments; the syntax has greatly changed.  
	    * cryptlink_error() extended to not only send messages to
	      admins, opers, and call exit_client (dynamically), but also
	      ilog().  About time! 
	    * Renamed select_cipher() to check_cipher().  
	    * Added #ifdef's around portions of CipherTable to ensure
	      completely that we do not even add the cipher to our list in the
	      case that autoconf does not find it to be a supported cipher.  This
	      is needed for the cipher detection methods which use CipherTable
	    anywhere.  
	* Removed all the silly cipher "priority" garbage.  Good riddance.  
	    * Much __MUCH__ better error handling and error descriptions. 
	      Now both ends of the link should get an idea of what's wrong.  
	    * Cosmetical changes.  
	    * Added some comments.  
	
	- modules/m_capab.c 
	    * Removed code to support multiple cipher preferences via ","
	      delim.  This is silly; pick a cipher and use it. 
	      Autonegotiation is pretty pointless for this kind-of communication
	      medium.  This should also speed up the code a bit; no more
	strtoken().  
	
	- modules/m_cryptlink.c 
	    * Renamed mr_cryptserv() to cryptlink_serv().  
	    * Renamed mr_cryptauth() to cryptlink_auth().  
	    * Added mr_cryptlink().  This function is VERY simple, and uses
	      a table (CryptLinkStruct) to refer to it's commands.  This
	      should be useful for the future, particularly in regards to things
	      like key regeneration and for general expansion.  Someone should
	      probably check mr_cryptlink() out for any problems, though.  
	    * Much __MUCH__ better error handling and error descriptions. 
	      Now both ends of the link should get an idea of what's wrong.  
	    * cryptlink_serv() and cryptlink_auth() both were doing
	      case-sensitive cipher checks; moved from strcmp() to
	strcasecmp().  
	
	- src/ircd_parser.y 
	    * In code pertaining to cipher_preference and
	      default_cipher_preference, __completely__ changed how the cipher
	      mechanism is done.  Before, we were doing some hoky crap with memory
	      allocation and creating a buffer for "cipher priority".  All of this
	      is now gone.  Instead, we use pointers to point into CipherTable. 
	    This is *FAST AND CLEAN*.  Yay.  
	* Fixed bug: /REHASH could possibly corrupt the key on an error.  
	    * Fixed minor memory leak (I think; could be wrong on this one).  
	    * Changed some error messages to be more clear.  
	    * Cosmetical changes.  

2001-07-02 09:41  androsyn

	* adns/: reply.c, internal.h: Fixes EO's bug with recursive CNAMEs.

2001-06-30 18:56  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Added flags to adns_submit_reverse to make CNAME's in
	PTRs work a bit better. Patch submitted by EO.  

2001-06-29 09:03  leeh

	* modules/m_resv.c, src/resv.c: 
	- fixed the compile warnings..  

2001-06-29 00:25  a1kmm

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- Set uplink to NULL on changing to a hub.  

2001-06-28 15:57  leeh

	* include/resv.h, modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, src/resv.c: 
	- I should probably actually add the files ;p 
	- made the makefiles compile them too 

2001-06-28 15:49  leeh

	* include/channel.h, include/hash.h, modules/m_join.c,
	modules/core/m_nick.c, modules/m_resv.c, src/channel.c, src/hash.c: 
	- hash tables hash tables everywhere! 
	
	  extending RESV support for nicks: 
	  -irc2.leeh.co.uk- *** Notice -- fl_!flame@irc2.leeh.co.uk{flame}
	  has placed a local RESV on nick: test 
	
	  -> Server: nick test 
	  test Nick/channel is temporarily unavailable 
	
	  it only works with /resv atm, im going to rename quarantine {}; to 
	  resv {}; (for obvious reasons.. dont wanna be too confusing now do
	  we) 
	
	  I would really, really like someone to review this.. but if you
	  wanna change stuff find me first.. as I know where resv is going
	;p 

2001-06-27 10:41  androsyn

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c: Commit of Diane's linebuf
	allocator thingy...  

2001-06-27 01:20  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h: 
	- Better commit this header so my mode code compiles...  

2001-06-26 22:17  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c: 
	- Fixed channel modes, hopefully they work entirely correctly now.  

2001-06-26 13:55  androsyn

	* modules/m_gline.c: Yet another memset 

2001-06-26 13:54  androsyn

	* adns/query.c: Even more random memset()'s 

2001-06-26 13:51  androsyn

	* src/: client.c, linebuf.c, s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, send.c: Remove some
	unnecessary memset()'s 

2001-06-26 13:45  androsyn

	* src/memory.c: Knocked off about 12 seconds of a burst by
	replacing malloc/memset with calloc. Go figure..  

2001-06-26 13:08  androsyn

	* include/memory.h: Its seems inlining MyMalloc() doesn't help
	much...  

2001-06-26 12:57  leeh

	* modules/m_join.c: 
	- moved the is_resv() check down to accomodate #x,#y 

2001-06-26 12:48  leeh

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_join.c, modules/m_post.c,
	modules/m_resv.c, src/channel.c, src/ircd.c: 
	- fixed a header in m_post.c 
	- added RESV - h7's channel jupes 
	
	  /RESV - locally "jupe" a channel, to prevent anyone joining that 
	          channel.  It will return the ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE numeric 
		  (juped).  
	  /UNRESV - remove a RESV thats been placed 
	
	  I shall extend it to nicks shortly.. as for permanence, I dont think 
	  it should be an issue.. if they want it permanent, they can add it
	  to ircd.conf ;p 

2001-06-26 12:27  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: Next time profile a function first before
	you go and replace it :P 

2001-06-26 12:09  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: Needed an #undef for on certain platforms..  

2001-06-26 12:09  androsyn

	* include/: irc_string.h, memory.h: Some definitions to support
	inlined versions of strcpy and MyMalloc() and friends...  

2001-06-26 11:07  androsyn

	* src/ircd.c: This seems to get bursts back down to closer to
	normal times..still not as fast as -6 though.  

2001-06-26 03:02  jdc

	* doc/technical/README.openssl: 
	- doc/README.openssl 
	    * More minor stuff; added a bit to the "SERVER CONFIGURATION"
	      section, with more to be added later in the future.  

2001-06-26 02:52  jdc

	* tools/mkkeypair: 
	- tools/mkkeypair 
	    * Someone wanted this awhile back.  I think it was you, greg. 
	    ;-) 

2001-06-26 02:50  jdc

	* doc/technical/cryptlink.txt: 
	- doc/cryptlink.txt 
	    * Minor changes (cosmetical, grammatical, typos).  

2001-06-26 02:18  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c: 
	- Tried to fix the mode code a little more. Still minor problems
	  with the stuff sent to the local client on -o+v 

2001-06-26 02:09  jdc

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- modules/m_whois.c 
	    * Minor warning fixed up (line 551; if statement
	    vague/ambiguous).  

2001-06-26 02:00  jdc

	* doc/technical/cryptlink.txt, doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/rsa.c, src/s_conf.c,
	src/s_serv.c: 
	- doc/cryptlink.txt 
	    * Fixed up "CAPAB <stuff>" -- should be "CAPAB :<stuff>".  
	- include/s_conf.h 
	  src/ircd_lexer.l 
	  src/ircd_parser.y 
	  src/rsa.c 
	  src/s_conf.c 
	  src/s_serv.c 
	    * rsa_private_key  -->  rsa_private_key_file 
	    * rsa_public_key   -->  rsa_public_key_file 
	      (No more sticking keys in the actual conf; finally actual
	      files!) Who wrote the original rsa_public_key code anyways? 
	      It was totally wacky (ascii!?!).  
	    * Fixed a few issues with some buffers not getting cleared
	      (regarding RSA keys) on /REHASH.  
	    * Fixed up some of the error checking code for public keys.  
	    * Fixed up some code which was doing error checking at the wrong 
	      time/wrong order.  
	- doc/example.conf 
	    * Changed examples to be precise with the above.  

2001-06-25 09:55  jdc

	* src/rsa.c: 
	- src/rsa.c  -- Looks like the RSA_free() prior to the PEM_ function 
	                results in a segfault.  I had a feeling about this; 
	                so what the hell are the OpenSSL people talking
	                about? 

2001-06-25 09:28  jdc

	* include/rsa.h, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/rsa.c: 
	- include/rsa.h  -- Changed verify_private_key() to return int.  
	  modules/m_cryptlink.c  -- Updated use of verify_private_key().  
	  src/rsa.c  -- Madness regarding OpenSSL.  I'm going to murder 
	                whoever wrote openssl/pem.h.  If things no longer 
	                work past this point, it's probably due to the 
	                typecast on line 110.  *sigh* 

2001-06-25 08:40  jdc

	* src/rsa.c: 
	- src/rsa.c 
	    * Changed the assignment for PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey(). 
	      There are bugs/caveats for using &ptr in the 2nd argument vs. an 
	      actual assignment with a TYPE_free() prior to it.  Don't
	      believe me? Check out
	    http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/pem.html#BUGS 
	* Changed the error checking drastically, matching with what the 
	      official OpenSSL documentation states we should do.  Now
	      things like specifying an invalid file in serverinfo{}'s
	      "rsa_private_key" should hopefully error out properly and not beat
	    the jig.  
	* Hoping these changes fix some major issues -- the first is a
	      pretty major one.  :-) 

2001-06-25 02:23  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: 
	- Fixed redundant ops/voices etc... removal 
	- Added redundant sync_oplists removal. Note that there is still a
	  bug I am looking for: /mode #chan +o-o on a non-opped user still
	  seems to sync_oplists and give away the oplist by deopping all the
	  ops for some reason. I will fix this later.  

2001-06-23 21:55  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_squit.c, src/client.c, src/hostmask.c,
	src/listener.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Committing jv's patch for the SQUIT bug.  
	- Fixed IPv4 dlines/exempts for IPv6 boxes.  
	- Fixed exempt matching for rate limiting.  

2001-06-23 06:02  leeh

	* modules/: m_cryptlink.c, m_svinfo.c, core/m_server.c: 
	- some get_client_name() updates..  

2001-06-23 04:35  db

	* modules/m_connect.c: 
	- fixed some formatting 

2001-06-22 08:24  leeh

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- if someone asks a server to reply about a client thats not his..
	  it HAS to be non-detailed, else the info is just gunna be wrong 
	
	- (the big one), made ms_whois() work.. if someone asks a LL to
	  answer about a client thats not /on/ the LL.. stuff will just break,
	  so the hub will answer for the LL 
	
	  this made the hub more conscious about what it can/cant do.. it 
	  could possibly be tidied up but its.. dodgy 
	
	  someone needs to audit this, its *very* well documented in the
	  source, you just need to follow it..  

2001-06-22 00:03  jdc

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- modules/m_gline.c: time_t warning (moved to %lu with a typecast).  

2001-06-21 17:09  leeh

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- added a missing #ifdef PACE_CONNECT 

2001-06-21 11:38  leeh

	* modules/core/m_squit.c: 
	- fixed serverhide bug in squit 

2001-06-21 11:25  leeh

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- heres another go :) 

2001-06-21 10:57  leeh

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- this should fix the whois bug 

2001-06-20 14:39  jdc

	* doc/technical/README.openssl: 
	- Whee.  Sorry to update the updated update *grin* kre, but I
	  figured with all of the recommended Solaris workarounds, this would
	  be a more effective way of listing them all.  Thanks for providing
	  more alternatives! 

2001-06-20 14:23  kreator

	* doc/technical/README.openssl: 
	- small openssl documentation updates: prngd, sunwski, andirand.  

2001-06-19 09:07  leeh

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- when we send glines to hyb6 servers, they need to come from the
	  opers server, not the opers nick..  

2001-06-19 02:58  jdc

	* doc/technical/README.openssl: 
	- doc/README.openssl 
	    Severe "touch-ups," and added a section pertaining to Solaris
	    and it's lack of /dev/random or /dev/urandom.  Hopefully this
	    will help Solaris users out a little bit.  

2001-06-19 01:25  db

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- redid m_gline to write kline.conf compatible files 

2001-06-19 00:54  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: 
	- Finished off Diane's USE_TABLE_MODE patch.  

2001-06-18 18:49  leeh

	* modules/: m_gline.c, m_kline.c: 
	- disallow ! in klines/glines..  

2001-06-18 02:26  jdc

	* BUGS: 
	- Mentioned the implicit decl. and warning messages during
	  compile-time, which pertain to OpenSSL.  People like Jamie will
	  bitch and whine, so might as well be precautious.  *grin* 
	- Reformatted some stuff (purely cosmetical).  

2001-06-18 02:20  jdc

	* include/rsa.h, include/s_conf.h, modules/m_cryptlink.c,
	src/rsa.c: 
	- Fixes compile issues with prior update for OpenSSL error logging.  
	  One small note:  There is no way I know of to get around the 
	  implicit declaration warning for PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey().  If 
	  you include <openssl/pem.h>, you break everything.  Either our SSL 
	  code is really, and I mean __REALLY__ bad, or OpenSSL is just a
	  hunk of junk.  fetchmail and mod_ssl don't have the problems we
	  are, though...  

2001-06-18 01:40  db

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: 
	- bug in USE_TABLE_MODE set_channel_mode code 
	  I've undeffed it for now until this fix is verified... This 
	  code should be rather more carefully tested...  
	- Basically chptr->chname does not always point at the real name as 
	  seen by users when on a vchan. The root channel name is passed to 
	  set_channel_mode() for this reason. set_channel_mode is given 
	  the chptr corresponding to the mapped channel (#foo_{TS}) but 
	  the local users should only see the "#foo" part, which is what
	  chname passed down is (the root channel name) 
	- I'm unable to test this fix atm. Someone else will have to ;-( 

2001-06-18 00:30  jdc

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/rsa.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- Modifications to support verbose logging for cryptlink problems.  
	  Patches originally written by einride.  Logging levels are
	  L_NOTICE and L_CRIT.  
	  Modified files: 
	    * include/s_conf.h 
	    * modules/m_cryptlink.c 
	    * src/ircd_parser.y 
	    * src/rsa.c 
	    * src/s_serv.c 

2001-06-17 23:09  a1kmm

	* .indent.pro: 
	- Committing my version of .indent.pro 

2001-06-17 10:10  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- ircsprintf() conveniently returns the length of string 

2001-06-17 08:17  toot

	* src/channel.c: renamed some stuff in channel.c so it makes some
	more sense 

2001-06-17 05:07  toot

	* .indent.pro, src/channel.c, src/vchannel.c: added -ncs to
	.indent..  
	(re)indented channel.c and vchannel.c..  

2001-06-17 04:43  toot

	* .indent.pro: added .indent.pro to use in other dirs "-gnu -nut
	-npcs -cdw" seems close to what we use..  feel free to change stuff
	:) 

2001-06-17 04:17  toot

	* src/channel.c: finished formatting channel.c 

2001-06-16 15:56  a1kmm

	* src/: hostmask.c, s_conf.c: 
	- Changed an irccmp to a match so we don't break host = "*.blah"; 

2001-06-16 14:57  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- same fix needed in hybrid-7 in attach_cn_lines 
	  both the servers irc name has to match and the host/ip 
	  match is used to allow hostmasking (ugh) 

2001-06-16 09:36  toot

	* src/channel.c: more formating fixes in channel.c 

2001-06-16 08:21  toot

	* src/channel.c: started reformatting some code in channel.c.. it
	was hell to read commited it so far so as not to get out of sync :) 

2001-06-16 01:12  a1kmm

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- '>' != '<' 

2001-06-16 01:11  a1kmm

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- Cleaned up remove_one_ip a little.  

2001-06-16 00:57  a1kmm

	* src/listener.c: 
	- Ripped out the last remnants of the TOO_MANY code I was going to
	  commit but then decided was pointless so ripped most of it before...  

2001-06-16 00:19  a1kmm

	* src/: channel.c, s_serv.c: 
	- Fixed that "/squit" bug where we don't remove channels/nicks from
	  a linked list.  
	- Ripped lazylink_nicks, it probably uses more cycles/memory than it
	saves.  

2001-06-15 23:50  jdc

	* doc/technical/README.openssl: 
	- doc/README.openssl: Lots of changes, and still some left to do (a 
	  section on how to modify your configuration file, and what's
	  what).  

2001-06-15 23:07  jdc

	* doc/technical/README.openssl: 
	* Small typos and the like.  

2001-06-15 19:55  a1kmm

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd.c, src/listener.c, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c,
	src/s_conf.c: 
	- 1 microsecond != 1 millisecond. Changed the delay stuff so ircd
	  doesn't hang for too long.  
	- Added some connect pacing(for 7.1). It is all wrapped in #ifdef
	for now.  

2001-06-15 13:50  toot

	* modules/m_names.c: /names should say "#channel End of /NAMES
	list.", even when the channel doesn't exist 

2001-06-15 03:26  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Fixed IPv6 klines.  

2001-06-15 01:42  toot

	* src/restart.c: fixed a compile warning..  

2001-06-14 13:48  androsyn

2001-06-13 17:23  leeh

	* doc/whats-new.txt: 
	- slight updates 

2001-06-13 17:14  leeh

	* modules/: m_oper.c, core/m_nick.c: 
	- started removing server names in collisions..  
	  the old ones are wrapped in #if 0 for now 
	- removed an excess ) from m_oper.c 

2001-06-13 10:41  leeh

	* src/client.c: 
	- ug, I came across check_klines() when trying to find this bug..  
	  it was just about unreadable..  

2001-06-12 21:57  androsyn

	* modules/m_oper.c: Cleaned up more abuses of inetntoa() 

2001-06-12 21:55  androsyn

	* modules/m_rehash.c: sockhost is the string version of the IP..duh
	:P 

2001-06-12 21:48  androsyn

	* include/irc_string.h: Minor cleaups...  

2001-06-12 21:47  androsyn

	* src/irc_string.c: Minor cleanups...  

2001-06-12 14:55  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Oops..i should have been checking to see if the
	connection was an AF_INET6 

2001-06-12 14:43  androsyn

	* src/s_conf.c: All this world is not 32bits...  

2001-06-12 14:23  androsyn

	* src/: s_bsd_devpoll.c, s_bsd_kqueue.c, s_bsd_poll.c,
	s_bsd_select.c: Forgot to commit these files as well with the
	previous commit 

2001-06-12 14:20  androsyn

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/s_bsd.c: Changes a bunch of unsigned long's
	to time_t's for timeouts..  

2001-06-12 14:12  androsyn

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure, include/setup.h.in: Fixes
	autoconf so that u_int32_t always is a 32bit integer on all
	platforms, include 64bit ones..  

2001-06-12 13:59  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Maybe this will fix the ipv6 . problem 

2001-06-12 11:11  androsyn

	* src/Makefile.in: Fixed Makefile.in after I borked it last night.  

2001-06-11 21:51  androsyn

	* src/Makefile.in: Helps if you commit the right makefile.in 

2001-06-11 21:50  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Disable iauth and
	libnsl/libresolv checks, as we really don't need, or want these
	libraries.  

2001-06-11 13:46  toot

	* modules/m_svinfo.c: slight cosmetic fix to the TSdelta notice to
	admins.  

2001-06-11 12:56  leeh

	* include/client.h, modules/m_cryptlink.c, modules/m_svinfo.c,
	modules/core/m_server.c, src/client.c, src/m_error.c, src/parse.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c, src/send.c: 
	- FLAGS_ADMIN -> FLAGS_SERVADMIN 
	  this means the notices goes to admins who are +s, and not all
	  admins..  (this is how it shouldve been) 
	- FLAGS_NOTADMIN -> FLAGS_SERVOPER 
	  as above 

2001-06-11 12:38  androsyn

	* src/ircd.c: Its always useful to rearm your timer.  

2001-06-11 12:36  androsyn

	Apparently VMS's compiler whined too..  

2001-06-11 11:05  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_devpoll.c: Fixed /dev/poll to do something useful other
	than eat cpu..  

2001-06-10 19:49  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_devpoll.c: Turned off logging of /dev/poll that was
	filling my disk 

2001-06-10 15:29  kreator

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- added /usr/pkg and /usr/local paths for openssl detection since i
	  have systems with those paths used for ssl - NetBSD, etc.  

2001-06-10 09:41  toot

	* src/s_conf.c: put that assert back in get_oper_name 

2001-06-10 06:13  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- I should not commit code when tired.  
	  anyway, this fixes a NULL pointer.  

2001-06-09 23:46  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- don't check that assert unless uplink is NON NULL dork 

2001-06-09 23:12  db

	* src/: channel.c, s_serv.c: 
	- don't make uplink a non local server. this really should NOT
	happen...  
	- assert if uplink is a non local server, furthermore whine to
	  logging if it is.  

2001-06-09 22:12  a1kmm

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: 
	- Cleaned up + optimised the USE_TABLE_MODE stuff.  

2001-06-09 18:09  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c: More mode table stuff: 
	- Implement +I/+e 
	- Fix -v+o sort of case.  
	- Send nothing on +n-n sort of thing.  

2001-06-09 17:03  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- allow opers to always send through a +g 

2001-06-09 11:56  toot

	* modules/m_kline.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_conf.c: fixed some compile
	warnings 

2001-06-09 11:37  toot

	* src/s_conf.c: fixed possible overflow in get_oper_name, and
	removed the assert 

2001-06-09 04:16  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c: 
	- We probably want to #if 0 this out until 7.1, especially as it
	  isn't finished and it needs more stuff to be moved into headers
	etc... later.  
	- Implements a table driven channel mode system. Not quite complete,
	but almost.  

2001-06-09 01:35  androsyn

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/ircd.c, src/packet.c, src/s_auth.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_devpoll.c, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c,
	src/s_bsd_poll.c, src/s_bsd_select.c: Okay...this fixes the usleep
	hack.  Basically we end up doing the delay in select/poll/kqueue. 
	In the case of poll() we set the delay on the last poll list, which
	seems sane enough.  The biggest change here is the fact that we are
	no longer using time_t for delays, but an unsigned long, which is 
	holding a millisecond value.  I've tested the poll() case and that
	seems to work okay.  

2001-06-08 15:31  kreator

	- rewrite some repeating RAND_bytes calls 

2001-06-08 09:18  db

	- fixed header, it read convertconf still 
	- fixed spelling mistake seperate -> separate a very common one..  

2001-06-08 08:01  jdc

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	* Fixed time_t vs. long warnings (typecasted properly as '(long)').  

2001-06-08 03:52  leeh

	* README.FIRST, tools/Makefile.in, tools/convertklines.c: 
	- added convertklines to convert klines from old format -> new
	format

	* include/s_conf.h, src/kdparse.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- renamed KParseFile to parse_k_file DParseFile to parse_d_file 

2001-06-08 00:30  db

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- valid_comment() should only toss away " for now... could escape it
	in future 

2001-06-08 00:08  db

	* doc/kline.conf: 
	- what was this 0 length file doing here? 

2001-06-07 22:33  db

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_unkline.c, src/kdparse.c: 
	- unkline and undline now work with the new formats 
	- Exceptions to D and K lines MUST only be in ircd.conf now.  

2001-06-07 20:49  db

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, include/s_conf.h,
	modules/m_kline.c, src/kdparse.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- write the current_date to the reason field 
	- dline.conf cannot be == kline.conf now 
	- someone has to redo the unkline/undline code now.  

2001-06-07 20:13  db

	* doc/example.conf, include/s_conf.h, src/Makefile.in,
	src/kdparse.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- redid kline/dline parser to use a spreadsheet compatible file
	  format klines are now stored as discussed on ircd-coders 
	  "user","host","reason","time" (for now) I'll convert time 
	  to decimal field later, and add oper id ...  
	  for now this works..  
	- also fixed typo in example.conf pointed out by MrPerfect 

2001-06-06 21:32  jdc

	* src/Makefile.in: 
	* Fixed SSL_LIBS= =stuff.  Note the extra equals sign.  

2001-06-06 21:22  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: My attempt at fixing the SSL
	include/libs stuff..its good and likely I screwed pretty bad, but it
	worked for me :P 

2001-06-06 15:00  kreator

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- added missing #include <stdlib.h> for exit() calls in configure 

2001-06-06 14:48  jdc

	* contrib/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in, iauth/source/Makefile.in,
	modules/Makefile.in, servlink/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	tools/Makefile.in: 
	* Yup.  Here we go again.  Changes for OpenSSL to work properly
	  during make; servlink/Makefile.in was also majorly wrong, including
	  the SSL LIBS for INCLUDES rather than the INCLUDES, blah blah
	  blah...  It's all fixed now.  

2001-06-06 11:28  jdc

	* servlink/Makefile.in: 
	* Little fix for missing @SSL_LIBS@ (-L) in servlink/Makefile.in

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, contrib/Makefile.in,
	doc/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	tools/Makefile.in: 
	* Round 3 of the OpenSSL madness.  This *SHOULD* take care of
	  everything (isn't that what I said last time?).  Someone might want
	  to examine the Makefile.in's in other directories and see if they
	  need SSL though.  People, ***PLEASE TRY THIS OUT*** to make sure it
	  works for you.  

2001-06-06 08:39  androsyn

	* src/: irc_string.c, s_bsd.c: Lets see if this fixes the issue

2001-06-05 07:58  kreator

	* src/Makefile.in:

	  I forgot a break statement.  

2001-06-03 12:03  davidt

	  we can now have ipv6 only servers.. it relies on aftype= in the

	  Theres still a bug with ipv6 incoming connections.. if it resolves 
	  and you have the IP, not the host in the config, itll error and
	  give bad hostname.. we should accept both IP and host, and I dont
	  think I can fix this one.. andro? a1kmm? care to help? ;) 

2001-06-02 07:21  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in:

2001-06-02 05:15  davidt

	* src/s_conf.c: make STATIC_MODULES compile again 

2001-06-02 04:19  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	* --enable-openssl has changed quite dramatically.  See below.  
	    ! <non-existant>        : Try auto-finding OpenSSL.  
	    ! --enable-openssl      : Try auto-finding OpenSSL.  
	    ! --enable-openssl=DIR  : Use DIR as the OpenSSL **BASE
	    DIRECTORY**.  ! --disable-openssl     : Disable support for
	OpenSSL.  
	
	  The "auto-finder" checks /usr/include/openssl,
	  /usr/local/openssl/include, and /usr/local/ssl/include.  The first
	  is the stock location for FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x.  The second is the
	  stock location for FreeBSD's ports install of OpenSSL.  The third is
	  the path the "stock" OpenSSL source uses for the default install
	(/usr/local/ssl).  
	
	  Please note that --enable-openssl=PATH requires you to specify the 
	  **BASE DIRECTORY** where you installed OpenSSL.  Do **NOT**
	  include the actual include/ directory in the path.  
	
	  Thanks to wjr for bringing all of this to my attention.  

2001-06-01 22:52  ejb

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- and this.  

2001-06-01 22:48  ejb

	- and this one.  

2001-06-01 22:47  ejb

	* modules/m_info.c: 
	- VMS compile fix.  

2001-06-01 22:46  ejb

	* README.VMS, include/config.h, src/s_debug.c: 
	- removed last traces of CMDLINE_CONFIG.  

2001-06-01 05:20  leeh

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- commented out the module="some_module.so", for the admins who dont 
	  realise..  

2001-06-01 04:05  leeh

2001-05-31 17:55  davidt

	* include/send.h, modules/m_away.c, modules/m_cjoin.c,

	modules/m_wallops.c, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/ircdauth.c,
	src/s_conf.c, src/send.c: 
	- Replace sendto_*serv* with sendto_server.  
	  sendto_server(one, NULL, NULL, NOCAPS, NOCAPS, NOFLAGS, format,
	  ...) works like sendto_serv_butone() did before, perhaps it should
	  be made into a macro... but we don't seem to _use_ a simple
	  'sendto_serv_butone()' in many places any more, lazylinks/etc make
	it a bit more complicated.  
	- Also fix a few compile warnings, which mostly appear to have
	  already been committed by toot, so that just added some conflicts
	  for me to sort out before committing.  Maybe I should just do one
	thing at a time :) 

2001-05-31 16:25  toot

	* modules/m_gline.c, src/modules.c, src/s_conf.c: . added call to

	  * default ConfigFileEntry stuff is now set in
	  s_conf.c:set_default_conf().  
	* default stuff for blocks using yy_aconfs is done at the start of

	  * any validation of config stuff is now done in
	  s_conf.c:check_conf().  
	* validation of yy_aconf blocks is done at the end of the code, 
	    before add_conf*() is called.  
	  * we free anything we might have allocated in the config file
	    _BOTH_ in s_conf.c:clean_out_old_conf(), and ircd_parser.y.  
	    - ircd_parser.y incase a line is duplicated in a block.  
	    - clean_out_old_conf() incase a line is removed from the config
	  file.  
	* we no longer close listeners until we are about to call yyparse(), 
	    so if we abort, we don't end up with no open ports.  
	
	- Work remaining (someone else can do this if they want): 
	  * tidy up example.conf/simple.conf/ircd_parser.y/ircd_lexer.y 
	    -- rename some of the hideous options we have, like the 
	    double negative 'warn_no_nlines = no;' or 'non_redundant_klines
	  = no;'.  
	* clean up include/defaults.h - do we want a define for default 
	    options for every option?? 
	  * clean up include/config.h - it'd be nice if we could make the
	    remaining stuff configuarable through autoconf/ircd.conf too...  
	  * clean up set_default_conf()/check_conf() - the defaults are
	    reasonably sane I think, but could do with tweaking --
	    example.conf should probably either match these, or include
	    (default: ...) in a comment for each option.

	* README.VMS, configure, autoconf/configure.in, doc/example.conf,
	include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, include/defaults.h,
	include/m_info.h, include/s_conf.h, include/s_serv.h,
	include/setup.h_vms, src/class.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/packet.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- Pass one of config file cleanup.  
	  * config.h[.dist] is now a little cleaner, still some stuff to
	  sort out[1] 
	* defaults for ircd.conf stuff now go in defaults.h 
	  * added set_default_conf() and check_conf(): 
	      set_default_conf() - called before yyparse() to set
	                           ConfigFileEntry stuff to default values.  
	      check_conf()       - called after yyparse() to ensure that 
	                           ConfigFileEntry stuff is actually sane,
	                           and reset to defaults if not.  
	- Lots more to do... But this _works_ (hopefully), so I'm committing
	  it before doing anything insane.  
	
	[1] - MAX_BUFFER et all seem to be completely misused by the code,
	      so documenting what they do is impossible, since it seems to do
	      nothing useful.  

2001-05-30 23:23  db

	* doc/example.conf, include/hostmask.h, modules/m_stats.c,

2001-05-30 22:38  db

	* src/parse.c:

	* include/hostmask.h, include/s_conf.h, modules/m_stats.c,
	src/hostmask.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- ok, big revision of stats I, you can now show users nothing, 
	  everything, or matching auth blocks 
	
	  ill be doing the stuff for stats k/K tomorrow..  but for now, stats
	  K may be dodgy ;p 

2001-05-30 08:06  davidt

	* include/modules.h, src/Makefile.in, src/s_serv.c: 
	- Use fork() not vfork().  
	- Fix --disable-shared-modules build 
	- Add warning flags to compile of y.tab.c, so we see problems in 
	  ircd_parser.y...

2001-05-30 06:30  jdc

	* include/m_info.h, modules/m_info.c: 
	* m_info.c information is now in table form.  Hooray.  There are
	  still some remaining entries (particularly in m_info.h) which should
	  be moved (or better yet, removed!) in the future.  I'll be adding
	  more ConfigFileEntry variables to m_info.c in the near future.  

2001-05-30 04:06  leeh

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- removed negative number support in the yacc grammar for now.  

2001-05-29 20:06  ejb

	* src/getopt.c: 
	- VMS-style ircd/foo getopt support (only on VMS, not Unix).  

2001-05-29 19:59  ejb

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- set a process name on VMS.  

2001-05-29 15:50  leeh

	* modules/m_eob.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- eob has a problem with negative deltas.. just use the time
	  connected (its only a rough gauge anyway) 

2001-05-29 15:44  davidt

	* src/ircdauth.c: 
	- This fixes the compile for --enable-ipv6, and IPv6 should work as 
	  before... However, iauth certainly wont work for IPv6, but it
	  didn't even compile before this commit.  

2001-05-29 15:25  davidt

	* modules/m_cryptlink.c: 
	- Revert commit checking client_p->name is "", since i've no idea
	  what its trying to do, and it breaks stuff.  (heh. oddly enough
	  'Break Stuff' is currently playing on MTV2. weird.) 

2001-05-29 14:25  leeh

	- Fix connect_cipher_preference code in ircd_parser.y 
	- Fix 3 other minor problems in ircd_parser.y found when I compiled
	  it with warnings enabled 
	- Fix problem in servlink where EOF error messages weren't being
	displayed.  

2001-05-29 09:25  jdc

	* modules/m_info.c:

2001-05-29 09:20  jdc

	* tools/encspeed.c:

	  defining functions as static.  

2001-05-29 09:15  jdc

	src/channel.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c,
	src/vchannel.c: 
	* Support for a new general {} variable, 'max_chans_per_user'.  This 
	  replaces the previous (statically defined) MAXCHANNELSPERUSER.  
	  After adding this feature, I realised it should probably go into a 
	  class {} block.  However, the general {} method keeps with the 
	  historical aspect (being globally defined).  

2001-05-28 18:39  toot

2001-05-28 17:56  a1kmm

	* modules/m_cryptlink.c:

2001-05-28 13:35  androsyn

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y: Changed ipv4_vhost/ipv6_vhost

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- added ipv6_vhost="", and changed vhost= to ipv4_vhost=, this will 
	  allow us to connect to ipv4 servers using ipv4, and ipv6 servers 
	  using ipv6.. it doesnt actually do anything yet though :P 
	
	  if you have a vhost= line, change it to ipv4_vhost!

	- Correct configure.in detection of cast (oops) 
	- cipher_preference is now per-connect{} block, with a 
	  default_cipher_preference line in general{} 
	- Add modified version of encspeed.c from hybrid-6 cryptlinks patch 

2001-05-28 08:10  davidt

	* servlink/io.c: 
	- Fix HAVE_ZLIB vs HAVE_LIBZ #ifdef that resulted in any ziplinks
	  failing every 5 minutes.  bad david.  

2001-05-28 07:58  davidt

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- Fix autoconf to properly disable openssl on detecting a broken
	  version of OpenSSL.  
	- Make autoconf print out the detected ciphers on completion, in a
	  style that matches the cipher_preference=''; line.  

2001-05-28 07:09  jdc

	* contrib/: m_clearchan.c, m_opme.c: 
	* Updated the _version definitions in m_clearchan, m_nickinfo, and
	m_opme.  

2001-05-28 07:08  jdc

	* contrib/: m_clearchan.c, m_opme.c: 
	* Typecasted time_t references to their appropriate types (%ld being

2001-05-28 00:34  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- Ignore server commands from other servers with a user prefix.  

2001-05-27 21:27  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/setup.h.in, src/ircd.c: 
	* Added autoconf support for RLIMIT_* definitions; prior, all this

	- Make servlink/ as independant as possible from hybrid's build
	  setup, so it can be used hopefully unchanged (except for the
	  Makefile) in other projects that may want to. (e.g. hybserv).  
	  * Add servlink/setup.h 

2001-05-27 09:17  toot

	- Improve configure.in detection of gettext, openssl and zlib 
	- Fix problem with creating module installation dirs 
	- If read_packet is called for a 'dead' client, exit it.  
	  NOTE: since we don't exit_client in dead_link, there is a chance 
	        we can mark a client dead without exiting it.  
	        we can't exit any dead clients in parse.c, since we could 
	        have already exited it.  perhaps we need a new flag.  
	- servlink: Update docs to match implemented protocol 
	- servlink: Split process_command into different functions, and 
	            stick them into command_table.  

2001-05-26 15:59  leeh

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- commited pasky's patch so we now support ipv6 ips for outgoing 
	  connections 
	- im tempted to add vhost_ipv6="" then use ipv6/ipv4 depending on
	  the target.. as right now you either connect out on ipv4, or ipv6,
	never both 

2001-05-26 12:33  leeh

	* modules/m_ping.c: 
	- ok, based on comments ive changed the way we handle local pings: 
	  - if the ping isnt cross-server, origin == what they sent 
	  - if the ping is cross-server, origin == their nick 

2001-05-26 09:54  cosine

	* src/: Makefile.in, ircd.c, ircdauth.c, s_auth.c: 
	- fixed memory leak in s_auth.c 
	- iauth is now working again (under #define USE_IAUTH) 

2001-05-26 08:45  cosine

	* iauth/source/: auth.c, iauth.c, sock.c, Makefile.in: iauth
	compiles again 

2001-05-26 07:03  jdc

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/setup.h.in: 
	* Added support for time_t size checking during configure.  Would be 
	  appreciated if someone on a i386 Linux machine checked to see if
	  the configure output returns 'no' or 'yes'...  

2001-05-26 05:39  davidt

	* servlink/io.c, src/packet.c: 
	- Doh. hopefully fix the endianness issue with the servlink io code, 
	  which I missed when cleaning up the code (i fixed the code to read 
	  data lengths, but not commands, oops).  

2001-05-26 05:24  leeh

	* modules/m_ping.c: 
	- PING origin :destination 
	  why would the origin ever be anything but a clients nick, or a
	  servers name? 
	
	  the old code is #if 0'd for now.. if we're in agreement, we can
	  probably remove the origin variable altogether, and just use
	sptr->name..  

2001-05-25 17:48  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c:

	ahem..  

2001-05-25 17:27  ejb

	* src/version.com: 
	- added generation support to version.com.

	* include/channel.h, include/config.h, include/linebuf.h,
	modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c, src/linebuf.c, src/send.c: 
	- refcounts for outgoing sendbufs 
	  send.c now creates linebufs, which send_linebuf attaches to the 
	  clients sendq (increasing the refcount).  The same linebuf may 
	  be attached multiple times to different clents.  
	  As usual, send_queued_write will then call linebuf_flush, 
	  which will attempt to write the data to the net, and call 
	  linebuf_done_line (which now only frees the buf if the refcount 
	  is zero) if successful.  
	
	  We still do some weird stuff in send.c, and I'd be a lot happier if 
	  we adjusted sprintf_irc.c to contain a vsnprintf function, instead 
	  of relying on IRCD_BUFSIZE*2.  It might also be useful to create 
	  a varargs linebuf_put function to avoid vsnprintf'ing into a
	  buffer, then copying that into a linebuf.  
	
	- Add dlink_list locchanops, lochalfops, locvoiced, locpeons; to 
	  struct Channel; 
	  I'm not sure if this should stay...  
	  On the one hand: it speeds up
	  sendto_channel_local/sendto_common_channels on channels with a
	  large number of remote users.  On the other hand: it uses an extra
	  32bytes/channel + 48bytes/member, and also slows down MODE +ovh/-ovh
	  slightly on channels with lots of local users.  

2001-05-25 17:06  ejb

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Erp, we now set fds 3..LAST_SLINK_FD non blocking, not
	  0..LAST_SLINK_FD, somehow FreeBSD-CURRENT doesn't care, but
	  FreeBSD-STABLE really really does...  

2001-05-25 08:19  davidt

	- add support for reading from the servlink control fd in ircd.  
	- add error messages to servlink, which are displayed to all opers
	  on the local ircd...

	  called [see /stats E]).  

2001-05-25 07:43  leeh

	* src/s_misc.c:

2001-05-24 16:44  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Ugh. revert the last commit, we don't have the capab from the
	  remote server until it recognises the CRYPTSERV command, so we can't
	  do that must get more sleep....  

2001-05-24 16:37  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- test for ENC capab before trying to create an encrypted link, else 
	  the remote server doesn't respond to CRYPTSERV, and we sit there
	  for a while and time out...  

2001-05-24 16:15  davidt

	* src/modules.c: 
	- add cryptlinks commands to STATIC_MODULES list 

2001-05-24 16:09  davidt

	* servlink/: io.c, servlink.c, servlink.h: 
	- oops, miscounted a } in my fix, so cryptlinks + ziplinks broke.  
	  really really fix it this time. heh. I'm tired after a day of
	  debuging that evilness... :) 

2001-05-24 15:55  davidt

	* contrib/Makefile.in: 
	- hmm, forgot to commit this... remove outdated @SSL_*@ stuff from 
	  contrib/Makefile.in 

2001-05-24 15:48  davidt

	* servlink/: io.c, servlink.c, servlink.h: 
	- Remove some of the evil debugging stuff...  
	- Tidy up the code 

2001-05-24 15:42  ejb

	* servlink/descrip.mms, servlink/io.c, servlink/servlink.c,
	src/packet.c: 
	- SERVLINK support for VMS.  

2001-05-24 15:25  davidt

	* servlink/: io.c, servlink.c, servlink.h: 
	- EVIL EVIL EVIL EVIL EVIL EVIL bug. I'm stupid.  
	- I'll tidy up the mess i made of this code in a minute, but I can
	  barely beleive I found that bug, so I'm committing the fix now.  

2001-05-24 14:30  davidt

	* servlink/: io.c, servlink.c, servlink.h: 
	- erk, turn off slink-*-logs by default, since they could easily
	  become huge...  
	- also select different data to be logged, since the problem seems
	  to be 100% crypt related, now just log data pre/post
	  encrypt/decrypt, instead of as its read from the ircd, and as its
	written to the wire..  

2001-05-24 14:17  davidt

	* servlink/: io.c, io.h, servlink.c, servlink.h: 
	- Fix compiler warnings in servlink 

2001-05-24 13:02  davidt

	* servlink/: servlink.c, servlink.h: 
	- ick, commit _working_ IO logging support....  

2001-05-24 12:38  davidt

	* servlink/control.h, servlink/io.c, servlink/io.h,
	servlink/servlink.c, servlink/servlink.h, src/rsa.c: 
	- use checkError instead of a bunch of tests against
	  EAGAIN/-1/0/etc, the code should now: a) work on VMS, b) look
	slightly cleaner 
	- add optional (#define'able) IO logging in an attempt to track down
	  this evil bug where decryption fails for random blocks of data.  
	- add asserts to try to find said bug.  
	- move two break;s inside an #endif 

2001-05-24 10:42  androsyn

	* src/irc_string.c: Fixed for a very stupid buglet that would treat
	3ffe:x:x::1 as ::1

	  ircd.exe now builds and runs, and accepts clients.  
	  still servlink left to do.  

2001-05-24 08:45  davidt

	  evil bug which is in there somewhere...  

2001-05-24 06:25  kreator

	- fix self-referencing in README.FIRST :-) 

2001-05-24 03:22  toot

	modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/s_log.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c:

	src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- IRCD.EXE now compiles on VMS.  servlink not working yet, 
	  nor openssl etc. it doesn't seem to run after it compiles either.  

2001-05-23 14:45  davidt

	* modules/m_cryptlink.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- Add slightly more user-friendly error messages to m_cryptlink.c 
	- Fix stupid bug where both fd_note's were set on the same socket.  

2001-05-23 13:59  davidt

	servlink/io.c, servlink/servlink.c, servlink/servlink.h,
	src/client.c, src/packet.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- MISSING_SOCKPAIR support, for systems which don't support
	  SOCKPAIR, use individual (unidirectional) pipes to communicate with
	servlink.  

2001-05-23 12:46  davidt

	* servlink/servlink.c: 
	- fix non-openssl build 

2001-05-23 12:08  jdc

	* servlink/io.c: 
	* Fixed implicit decl. of bzero(3).  

2001-05-23 12:02  jdc

	* modules/m_cjoin.c, modules/m_join.c, modules/m_kline.c,

	src/s_log.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c: 
	* Changed a whole slew of long int references (%ld and %lu) to 
	  %d or %u.  Most of these went alongside channelts, which is 
	  defined as time_t.  

2001-05-23 11:53  leeh

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- kserver -> cryptlink 

2001-05-23 10:13  davidt

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure: 
	- Fix gettext detection 

2001-05-23 08:26  davidt

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Fix for an encrypted/compressed recvq overflowing the linebuf that 
	  it is stuffed into until we can hand it off to servlink to be
	  decrypted into something that we _can_ parse into lines, since it
	  may very well not include any \r\n chars....  

2001-05-23 07:29  davidt

	* servlink/: Makefile.in, io.c: 
	- Remove extra 'depend:' line 
	- Tidy up servlink code slighty 

2001-05-23 06:23  davidt

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, servlink/Makefile.in,
	servlink/io.c, servlink/servlink.c: 
	- Add check for openssl >= 0.9.6 
	- Convert servlink to the new dependency system 

2001-05-23 02:07  toot

	* modules/m_cryptlink.c, servlink/io.h: fixed a format error, and a
	couple of compile warnings 

2001-05-22 18:28  ejb

	* adns/Makefile.in, autoconf/configure.in, contrib/Makefile.in,
	modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	- better  make depend, no longer uses .depend; 

2001-05-22 12:11  davidt

	* servlink/README: Big commit of cryptlinks_ng-pre6b.diff.  
	
	There's only two remaining known issues with the
	servlink/cryptlink/ziplink code, and maintaining patch sets is
	becoming lots of work, so I'm committing this.  I think everyone
	agrees this should be in before 7.0 anyway, so it should get as much
	testing as possible in the tree...  
	
	Various things done: 
	- Added servlink, external process for server<->server links.  
		Known issue: decompression buffer can be filled, and the servlink 
			process will abort.  Need to flush the output then start 
			decompressing again, as increasing the size of the output 
			buffer beyond *6 is getting silly.  
	- Added hookq to configure.in to detect zlib.  
	- Fixed configure.in to detect openssl more sanely.  
	- Added cryptlinks support to ircd/servlink 
		Known bug: DES/56 and 3DES/168 doesn't work between hybrid-7 and 
			hybrid-6 servers.  This should be fixed by an update to 
			the hybrid-6 patch.  
	- Updated example.conf 
	- A few other bugfixes I can't remember, no doubt.

2001-05-22 11:33  toot

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_list.c: . changed /list so vchan
	  Id's show just before the topic, instead of in the channel name .
	renamed a variable in channel.h that was just 'blah' :) 

2001-05-22 08:32  toot

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: renamed num_bed to num_mask,
	there's no +d mode now 

2001-05-22 08:04  toot

	* contrib/: spy_links_notice.c, spy_whois_notice.c: added  those

	* contrib/spy_links_notice.c, contrib/spy_whois_notice.c,

2001-05-19 08:36  davidt

2001-05-18 22:09  a1kmm

	* src/s_serv.c: *sigh* yet another commit, we do check in
	sendnick_TS after all. Hopefully the last commit for this bug...  

2001-05-18 22:03  a1kmm

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Made client_burst_if_needed check the target actually is a client
	:) 

2001-05-18 21:56  a1kmm

	* src/send.c: 
	- Had second thoughts about my last commit - now we burst the client
	  sending the message if necessary. Also changed all of the functions.
	  Note however that we still need to change more of the functions to
	  use this new functionality by passing the source_p instead of
	client_p.  

2001-05-18 21:45  a1kmm

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_kline.c, src/channel.c, src/send.c: 
	- Don't send modes to lazy link clients for channels when the client
	  doing the mode change hasn't been burst. This is a pretty ugly
	  kludge as the mode is simply not sent(which could result in a
	  desync!) but it is better than having the mode dropped and the
	client sending it killed.

	  a side effect being all remote klines prior to this wont work :P 

2001-05-17 13:05  toot

	* modules/m_gline.c: simplifies things in ms_gline a little more 

2001-05-17 12:44  jdc

	* modules/m_gline.c: it was okay before, actually :P 

2001-05-17 09:31  toot

	- let halfops see and set +eI 

2001-05-16 10:51  leeh

	* modules/m_gline.c: 
	- check parc == 5, because if we trust hyb6 glines.. we'll gline the 
	  oper instead of the target..  

2001-05-16 09:59  leeh

	* modules/: m_gline.c, core/m_sjoin.c:

	the rest of the poll() stuff is...  
	
	seemed to make ircd spin out of control.. it was stuck on 100% cpu..  
	so its reverted, dunno what this actually did though..  

2001-05-07 16:51  androsyn

	* autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in, modules/Makefile.in: 
	Fixed various minor issues with autoconf...  

2001-05-07 14:27  fl_

	* include/hostmask.h, src/hostmask.c: 
	- #if IPV6 -> #ifdef IPV6 

2001-05-07 08:50  toot

	* doc/example.conf, include/config.h.dist, include/s_conf.h,
	modules/m_info.c, modules/m_oper.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y: removed show_failed_oper_id cause it was
	redundant.. failed_oper_notice does the same thing 

2001-05-06 04:08  androsyn

	* modules/Makefile.in: Seems I broke the modules install
	process..this fixes it now..  

2001-05-05 20:11  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: Try setting the delay rate for the poll
	idleclient to 0 like the rest of the poll() stuff is...  

2001-05-05 17:04  androsyn

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/acconfig.h,
	autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in, modules/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in: Added support for statically linked modules within
	autoconf.  Use ./configure --disable-shared-modules to get
	statically linked ones...  

2001-05-05 14:56  fl_

	* modules/m_stats.c:

2001-05-05 14:50  fl_

	* include/s_serv.h, modules/m_stats.c, src/s_serv.c:

	- added mo_stats() 

2001-05-05 06:46  fl_

	* INSTALL: 
	- slight update :P 

2001-05-05 06:37  fl_

	* include/config.h: 
	- till make install takes account of the paths in config.h, people
	  shouldnt change the paths in there.. especially not the modules
	  ones.. so warn them not to :P 

2001-05-04 19:17  db

	- major major stupid buffer overflow in send.c MEA CULPA fixed.  

2001-05-04 18:38  androsyn

	* src/ircd_parser.y: Added a check for spoofs to prevent moron
	server admins from doing stupid things like having spoofs in excess
	of HOSTLEN.

	modules/core/m_part.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c,
	src/client.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- dont burst persistant channels 
	- destroy_channel() if the user is parting.. persistant chans should
	  only be for splits imo, else users are just gunna break their
	channels ;) 
	
	  ideally this should be extended to quits which arent a netsplit..
	  but ill see about that another day :P 

2001-05-02 17:18  androsyn

	* src/: s_bsd_poll.c, s_bsd_select.c: I think I really found the
	source of fl_'s cores.  Basically what was happening was we were not
	resetting the callback to NULL like we do for
	s_bsd_kqueue/s_bsd_devpoll so I *think* we were calling the callback 
	multiple times.  

2001-05-02 16:07  toot

	* include/supported.h: added WALLCHOPS to 005 numeric, as we
	support /notice @#channel 

2001-05-02 16:00  toot

	* include/supported.h: updated PREFIX format in 005 numeric, and
	added CHANMODES=A,B,C,D see supported.h

2001-05-02 09:53  androsyn

	* src/send.c: Undo my send_queued_write() hack..  

2001-05-02 09:31  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Another assert() to try to catch fl_'s cores...  

2001-05-02 02:09  a1kmm

	- added hostmask docs.  

2001-05-02 01:09  a1kmm

	* src/packet.c:

	* include/client.h, include/config.h, modules/core/m_message.c,
	modules/core/m_mode.c, modules/core/m_part.c, src/linebuf.c,
	src/packet.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- Sanified the flood checking and sendq checking code a little.  

2001-05-01 23:27  db

	* modules/: m_topic.c, core/m_mode.c: 
	- removed caching of channels for lazylinks in mode and topic 
	  I think those were the two flame was complaining about.  

2001-05-01 12:06  ejb

	* src/getopt.c: 
	- typo.  

2001-05-01 12:02  ejb

	* src/getopt.c: 
	- fixed STRING types in getopt.c.  

2001-05-01 11:58  db

	* messages/translations/: ircd-croatian.po, ircd-danish.po,
	ircd-dutch.po, ircd-german.po, ircd-norwegian.po, ircd-spanish.po,
	ircd-swedish.po: 
	- %c -> %s 

2001-04-30 13:08  fl_

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- stats fixy thing :P 

2001-04-30 11:56  toot

	* modules/m_stats.c: use the parser to do the parc check in m_stats
	instead..  

2001-04-30 08:52  jdc

	* messages/: ayb.po, custom.po: 
	* Previous changes to message.tab applied to these two .pos.  

2001-04-30 08:32  jdc

	* src/messages.tab: 
	* RPL_ENDOFSTATS was returning the requested STATS character/word as 
	  a %c, while the argument passed in m_stats() was a string.  All 
	  fixed (%c --> %s).  

2001-04-30 08:31  jdc

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	* m_stats() did not check the parc count.  Doing a /STATS without
	  any arguments could result in the server just sitting there until
	  some output was sent, then the connection would be severed.  
	* Please note the change to message.tab (in another update) -- this
	  is CRUCIAL to the above fix.  
	* Added descriptions for the STATS letters in stats_let_table[]. 
	  This will be used (in the future) for for something like /STATS
	  HELP, once word-based STATS are added.  

2001-04-30 07:03  ejb

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- call valid_comment even for IPv6..  

2001-04-29 22:52  a1kmm

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- Fixed the compile warnings with fl_'s stats code.  

2001-04-29 14:39  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: Removed the assert()'s andrew had put there. 
	This seems to get rid of the cores. But now I need to figure out why
	poll() performance sucks so bad, other than it being poll() which
	sucks by nature.  

2001-04-29 12:31  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: Hmm..okay..a slightly different assert...  

2001-04-29 12:10  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: Added "yet another assert"(tm) to track down
	fl_'s core.  

2001-04-29 10:05  fl_

	* doc/example.conf, modules/m_stats.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- couple of small bugs in stats 
	- replaced unused things in stats Q with "*" 
	- exempt {}; dont have reasons..  

2001-04-29 07:23  fl_

	* contrib/spy_stats_notice.c, include/hook.h, modules/m_stats.c: 
	- massive rewrite of m_stats.c to use a table based lookup for
	  stats..  this means we can now support /stats auth etc.. dont
	  attempt it yet tho, the table hasnt been filled with the things ;) 

2001-04-29 01:46  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Fixed to make solaris 8 compile properly for IPv6 

2001-04-28 16:23  a1kmm

	* src/: s_bsd.c, s_bsd_poll.c: 
	- Added some more asserts to fd code to try and catch fl_'s core at
	  an earlier and more useful stage.  

2001-04-28 08:56  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kick.c: 
	- dont warn ops that halfops are trying to kick them, we dont do it
	  for voices/peons, so why start now? 

2001-04-28 08:52  jdc

	* src/ircd.c: 
	* Added support for -pidfile command-line argument, a la toot.  

2001-04-28 08:43  fl_

	* contrib/m_clearchan.c: 
	- send kickers nick, not servername 

2001-04-28 08:21  jdc

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	* Bump up the _version string.  

2001-04-28 08:17  jdc

	* modules/core/m_kick.c: 
	* A non-opped client in a +a channel should be shown the local
	  server that kicked them, NOT their own nick (eg. me.name  vs. 
	who->name).  
	* Server-based kicks (for things like CLEARCHAN) now show the actual 
	  server that did the CLEARCHAN (previously it showed your own
	  nick).  The reason for this is somewhat political (sptr->name vs.
	  me.name): in the case of oper abuse, the user should have *some*
	  idea of what server requested the CLEARCHAN, in the case of an oper
	  getting out of control.  This therefore provides some security for
	  the user who's channel just got cleared.  

2001-04-28 07:40  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- you know, I just hate irc clients.  

2001-04-28 07:28  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- shouldnt really send our name, then the path, then the reason ;P 

2001-04-28 06:28  habeeb

	* modules/m_names.c: Modified NAMES to work with vchans.  "NAMES
	<channel> [vkey]".  If no vkey is specified it will check if you are
	on <channel> or one of its vchans and default to that channel. 
	Otherwise a list of vchans are specified.  "NAMES <channel> !" will
	give a list of channels since the key is invalid.  It should not
	break current clients.  

2001-04-27 20:32  habeeb

	* src/vchannel.c: Fix for vchan listing bug.  

2001-04-27 17:52  habeeb

	* modules/m_names.c: Fix for similar bug that was in WHO.  

2001-04-27 14:14  habeeb

	return half ops before voice.  

2001-04-27 14:09  habeeb

	* modules/m_whois.c: Fix for WHOIS buffer overflow in listing
	channels pointed out by pasky.  

2001-04-27 03:59  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- you cant add brackets if the kill isnt yours :) 
	  if you do your gunna end up with a reason like ((((((ghost))))))
	  ;P 

2001-04-26 19:48  jdc

	* src/s_bsd_kqueue.c: 
	* Fixed unused retval variable in kq_update_events() via #if 0.  
	* In kq_update_events(), kqoff was never set to 0 correctly (typo; 
	  someone had "== 0", not "= 0").  

2001-04-26 19:44  jdc

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	* Fixed unused path declaration via #if 0.  
	* ms_kill() lacked a "(%s)" for the kill reason at the end of the
	function.  

2001-04-26 06:24  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- ok, this should fix kill 
	  parv[2] contains both path and reason.. to save us splitting
	  parv[2] up to get at the path.. we generate the path ourselves
	  (user who sent the kills server/host/ident/nick)..  

2001-04-26 05:32  fl_

	* src/ircd_parser.y:

2001-04-26 00:53  kreator

	* README.FIRST: 
	- no need to ask for getopt() in README.FIRST, since we provide one
	  (ejb-s fix) 
	- added NetBSD in tested platforms (I run hyb6&7 there) 

2001-04-25 17:49  fl_

	* modules/m_cryptlink.c: 
	- ifdef 0 -> if 0 

2001-04-25 15:15  kreator

	* tools/convertconf.c:

	  oper_umodes line.  

2001-04-25 01:18  toot

	* Hybrid-team: Adding me, because I'm bored.  

2001-04-24 20:37  androsyn

	send_queue_write() before entering select/poll/kqueue now.  

2001-04-24 19:42  androsyn

	* src/irc_string.c: Really fix the ::1 stuff. It seems that the
	COMPAT macro doesn't see ::1 as a ipv4 compatible address.  

2001-04-24 19:17  androsyn

	* src/irc_string.c: Fixed the ::1 stuff for good :) 

2001-04-24 18:51  db

	  tested..  

2001-04-24 14:45  androsyn

	* BUGS: The ::1 bug is fixed by mapping it to its ipv4
	counterpart..  

2001-04-24 14:42  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: This hack will map ::1 to 127.0.0.1 along with any
	other IPv6 addresses that have the upper 96bits set to 0.  

2001-04-24 14:33  androsyn

	* BUGS, src/adns.c: Fixed coredump if /etc/resolv.conf is
	unreadable.  We log the event to the logfile right now.  I need to
	move the dns init up further in the init process so we can output to
	standard error.  

2001-04-24 02:47  habeeb

	* autoconf/configure.in, include/setup.h.in, modules/m_away.c,

	when returning from recv()

	- fix example conf: we don't support cpp, but we do support .include 
	  "blah" and .include <blah> 
	- add check_pidfile() that does kill 0 ircd_pid from PPATH: that
	  will check if there exists another daemon running and exit if it is
	there 

2001-04-21 11:23  fl_

	* src/s_debug.c: 
	- changed an assert to a simple warning.. its a bit too highly
	  sensitive to have an assert there..

	  we should probably encourage a bit more wider usage of it too..

	* modules/m_join.c, modules/core/m_part.c, src/channel.c: 
	- Adding habeeb's patch to fix the antispambot code.  
	- Added a check on part message similar to that for QUIT to decide
	  if the part reason should be allowed to be shown.  

2001-04-18 21:29  a1kmm

	* modules/: m_kline.c, m_unkline.c: 
	- Fixed the code to prevent redundant K-lines.  
	- Made sure we can always remove K-lines which are placed.  

2001-04-18 19:53  a1kmm

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_testline.c, modules/m_unkline.c,
	src/hostmask.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Fixed unkline/undline to work properly with hostmasks. Still a bit
	  messy, and the rehash at the end is really bad, however.  

2001-04-18 04:37  a1kmm

	* modules/m_testline.c, src/client.c, src/hostmask.c,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Fixed hostmask code to work with exempt{} blocks.  

2001-04-18 03:57  fl_

	* doc/example.conf, include/hostmask.h, modules/m_stats.c,
	src/hostmask.c: 
	- we now have stats e.. admittedly it doesnt actually do anything
	  yet, but ill sort that later 

2001-04-18 03:15  fl_

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- framework for exempt blocks 

2001-04-18 03:05  jdc

	* doc/example.conf: 
	* example.conf incorrect in regards to vhost="" syntax.  Fixed.  

2001-04-18 01:08  jdc

	* src/ircd.c: 
	* Added display of pid to startup output.  

2001-04-17 15:35  fl_

	* include/client.h, include/s_conf.h, modules/m_kline.c,
	src/client.c, src/hostmask.c, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c,
	src/s_gline.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- Eline -> ExemptKline 
	- Fline -> ExemptLimits 

2001-04-17 14:21  toot

	* src/class.c: this fixes the coredump if you did /trace with any
	"unknown" connections 
	
	get_class_name needed to default to something rather than NULL :) 

2001-04-16 04:42  fl_

	* BUGS, doc/example.conf: 
	- minor updates 

2001-04-15 17:03  fl_

	* BUGS: 
	- updated bugs with the msglocale stuff..  

2001-04-15 02:44  toot

	* modules/m_time.c, src/ircd.c, src/md5.c, src/s_log.c: a few
	little cleanups 

2001-04-14 08:34  davidt

	* src/: linebuf.c, packet.c, send.c: Fix non OPENSSL build 

2001-04-13 15:39  davidt

	* doc/technical/cryptlink.txt, doc/example.conf, include/client.h,
	include/linebuf.h, include/md5.h, include/rsa.h, include/s_conf.h,
	include/s_serv.h, modules/Makefile.in, modules/m_challenge.c,
	modules/m_close.c, modules/m_cryptlink.c, modules/core/m_server.c,
	src/Makefile.in, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/linebuf.c, src/listener.c, src/md5.c,
	src/packet.c, src/parse.c, src/rsa.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c,
	src/send.c: 
	- Add CRYPTLINK (formerly KSERVER) support.  
	  It seems to be mostly working, however: 
	  * The protocol will probably change next week, to be compatable
	    with hybrid 6, etc..  
	  * There's a few possible bugs I can see in the code, but there's
	    no sane way of fixing them until I (or someone else, hint hint :), 
	    creates a 'helper' process for server<->server links, which 
	    handles ziplinks/cryptlinks etc.  

2001-04-13 06:36  fl_

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- added a warning about the order of auth blocks 

2001-04-11 20:37  db

	* src/s_log.c: 
	- formatting fix 

2001-04-11 03:24  fl_

	* Hybrid-team: 
	- added kre to contributors 

2001-04-11 03:20  kreator

	* src/ircd_lexer.l: 
	- oops, forgot to reinit lineno and include_stack_ptr to make lexer 
	  reentrant.  

2001-04-11 02:51  a1kmm

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- oops, forgot a DupString in parsing deny blocks in the parser.
	  This fixes it.  

2001-04-10 16:43  kreator

	* src/: Makefile.in, ircd_lexer.l: Made .include for lexer.  

2001-04-10 15:55  db

	* src/messages.tab: 
	- RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN third arg should have been a %s, remnant of 
	  the class # to class name move. oops. reported by Joao Luis
	  Marques Pinto Lamego@PTlink.net 

2001-04-09 22:21  a1kmm

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_stats.c, modules/m_testline.c,
	src/hostmask.c: 
	- Oops, do not delete tklines on rehash! 
	- Fixed testline a little to match "user@*" I-lines when an IP
	address is given.  

2001-04-09 05:41  fl_

	* modules/: m_admin.c, m_info.c, m_lusers.c, m_motd.c, m_stats.c,
	m_time.c, m_users.c, m_whowas.c: 
	- added serverhiding checking to commands that can be used
	remotely..  

2001-04-09 04:03  a1kmm

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Removed a htonl that shouldn't be there... so now vhosts should
	work.  

2001-04-09 03:38  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Think that this gets the endianness right for the hash.  

2001-04-09 02:02  a1kmm

	* modules/m_ping.c: 
	- GlobalSetOptions != ConfigFileEntries. Always check stuff works
	  before you commit :) 

2001-04-09 01:49  a1kmm

	* modules/m_ping.c: 
	- Always reply locally when a non-oper tries to use PING to ping a
	  server and hide_server is on.  

2001-04-09 01:29  a1kmm

	* doc/example.conf, include/hostmask.h, include/s_conf.h,
	modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_kline.c, modules/m_stats.c,
	modules/m_testline.c, modules/m_unkline.c, src/Makefile.in,
	src/client.c, src/getopt.c, src/hostmask.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/listener.c, src/s_conf.c,
	src/s_gline.c: 
	- Did my hashtable lookup code for hosts/addresses properly - now
	  replaces patricia tries too, and provides proper IP parsing to
	  replace is_address that works with IPV4 and IPV6. This also means
	  that both CIDR and ip.* work with both IPV4 and IPV6.  
	- Changed the parser a little, so that we now simplify things by
	  putting IP addresses in quotes. Deleted the complicating user=a@b vs
	  ip=... ipv6=...  thing for auth{} blocks, we now always do user=a@b,
	  but we can put IPs(both V4 & V6) into the auth{} block. This means
	  we can specify a username too, and simplifies things, although it
	does make unchanged older confs incompatible.  

2001-04-08 11:03  fl_

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- moved the bogus TS message to FLAGS_DEBUG 
	- updated opers.txt 

2001-04-08 09:27  fl_

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- fixed a small bug 

2001-04-07 13:26  toot

	* modules/m_invite.c, src/vchannel.c: /invite was showing the
	secret vchan name to users, cleaned m_invite a bit too fixed
	"voodoo" invites on root chans 

2001-04-06 02:36  fl_

	* TODO: 
	- updated todo a bit..  

2001-04-06 02:30  a1kmm

	* adns/event.c, adns/internal.h, adns/reply.c, adns/setup.c,
	adns/tvarith.h, src/adns.c: 
	- Started the long process of reviewing and tidying up/documenting
	  the adns code. Unfortunately, there is still much more to do. By
	  doing this, hopefully we will make it easier to find and fix some of
	  those adns cores that keep happening.  

2001-04-05 16:18  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Added a few asserts to check for NULL callbacks. I'm
	still not sure why this is happening though.  

2001-04-04 09:17  androsyn

	* include/modules.h, src/ircd_parser.y, src/modules.c: Additional
	changes for static modules.  We just need to make the build system
	deal with this now.  

2001-04-04 08:22  androsyn

	* modules/: m_accept.c, m_admin.c, m_away.c, m_capab.c, m_cburst.c,
	m_challenge.c, m_cjoin.c, m_close.c, m_connect.c, m_dmem.c,

	m_user.c, m_userhost.c, m_users.c, m_version.c, m_wallops.c,
	m_who.c, m_whois.c, m_whowas.c: First half of my attempt to do
	statically loaded modules.  I suppose that either all or none with
	static/dynamic modules, for the sake of simlicity.  

2001-04-03 21:52  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Fixed a particular adns core..i don't think this was
	the one walter was talking about.  

2001-04-03 11:00  ejb

	code.  

2001-04-02 22:55  androsyn

	* src/s_conf.c: Fixed adns /rehash core..  

2001-04-02 19:35  db

	- Edward, could you review this? 
	  this fixes botch with getops.h 

2001-04-01 17:06  toot

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y: removed some old stuff from
	the parser

2001-04-01 16:14  toot

	* src/ircd.c: fixes a couple of compile warnings in ircd.c..  

2001-04-01 15:06  ejb

	* doc/technical/message-customisation.txt, src/getopt.c:

	- added first stab at new command line arguments system..  
	  not yet tested well, seems to work ok though.  

2001-04-01 06:45  ejb

	* include/setup.h.in, src/ircd.c: 
	- fix for broken daemon(), caused abort upon start.  

2001-03-31 16:01  db

	- one more batch of cleanups on s_debug.c 

2001-03-31 15:23  ejb

	  rebuilt dependencies.  

2001-03-31 10:56  ejb

	* src/s_debug.c: 
	- remove 'always on' things from s_debug.c 
	  No point putting them in if they never change..  

2001-03-30 20:44  db

	* src/s_debug.c: 
	- removed the /rehash GC from opers.txt 
	- cleaned up s_debug.c a tad more, added in stats for bans, invex,
	except 
	- renamed cryptic variable names into more self documenting ones in 
	  s_debug.c 

2001-03-30 13:13  ejb

	* modules/m_rehash.c, src/ircd_lexer.l: 
	- added kre's /* */ comment code to the lexer 
	- properly fixed /rehash gc core (what's the point 
	  in keeping it and not making it do anything? just 
	  remove the whole thing).  

2001-03-30 10:46  androsyn

	* modules/m_rehash.c: Removed a reference to the block allocator in
	m_rehash.c that prevented it from being loaded.  

2001-03-29 15:21  fl_

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- never do testing in BitchX..  

2001-03-29 15:10  fl_

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- transferred the masking from channel.c for /names to m_who.c for 
	  /who..  we now randomly poll /who lists too..  

2001-03-29 02:11  db

	* adns/Makefile.in, include/client.h, include/linebuf.h,
	include/list.h, include/s_conf.h, modules/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/linebuf.c,
	src/list.c, src/s_debug.c: 
	- cleaned up s_debug.c memory reporting somewhat, there is still 
	  a duplicate user memory report to cleanup 
	- cleanedup the linebuf.c code a bit, removed unnecessary gotos
	(*fwap* adrian) 
	- bsd make does not like not having quotes around .includes, I have 
	  been bad, and temp commented them out for now...  

2001-03-28 12:56  db

	* src/: client.c, list.c, memory.c, s_bsd.c: 
	- more cleanups 

2001-03-28 06:15  androsyn

	* src/s_auth.c: Fixed adns core.  Somebody accidently forgot to set
	the callback for auth_dns_callback().  -Wall caught this rather
	easily. BTW -Wall should probably be turned on for gcc by default.  

2001-03-28 02:04  fl_

	* adns/Makefile.in, contrib/Makefile.in, iauth/source/Makefile.in,
	modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	- changed lots of include ".depend" into include .depend..  

2001-03-28 01:23  fl_

	* contrib/m_clearchan.c: 
	- we were potentially joining a user to a channel more than once..
	  not a good thing..  

2001-03-27 22:50  db

	* include/ircd_defs.h, include/memory.h, include/res.h,
	src/Makefile.in, src/adns.c, src/client.c, src/event.c,
	src/linebuf.c, src/list.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_conf.c,
	src/s_debug.c: 
	- Massive commit to remove blalloc.c code, first pass through 
	  When we first did blalloc, systems did not use block allocators
	  for malloc, now they all do. blalloc.c/blalloc.h have now outlived
	  their usefulness.  

2001-03-27 21:50  androsyn

	* src/: adns.c, s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_conf.c: Fixed stupid connect
	bug...the block heap doesn't memset() our blocks..grr...  

2001-03-26 15:16  ejb

	BOOM!! 
	
	<Dianora> What happen? <Rodder> Someone set up us the IRCD!! 
	<Rodder> Main server turn on.  <Dianora> It's you.  <madmax> How are
	you client_ps? <madmax> All your root chptr are belong to us! 
	<madmax> You have no chance to rehash <madmax> Make your time.  
	<madmax> Ha Ha Ha.  
	
	- added ayb.po 
	- fixed custom.po 

2001-03-25 09:00  davidt

	* doc/example.conf: Reformatted example.conf to 80 chars wide 

2001-03-23 16:21  ejb

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- updated example.conf to match the new parser.  

2001-03-23 03:47  ejb

	* autoconf/acconfig.h, doc/example.conf, include/fileio.h,
	include/setup.h.in, src/s_conf.c: 
	- added cpp support to the parser.  
	  we now pass ircd.conf through 'cpp -P' before we pass it 
	  to lex.  this could possibly be implemented slightly better 
	  (esp. error checking).  

2001-03-23 01:43  ejb

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y: 
	- add support for decades, centuries, millannia, 
	  and terabytes in the parser.  

2001-03-23 01:38  toot

	* src/: s_user.c, send.c: couple of fixes for fussy compilers 

2001-03-23 01:29  ejb

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- add support for '1 minute 30 seconds' and suchlike in the parser.  

2001-03-23 00:58  ejb

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- add a simple arithmatic parser to ircd.conf.  it understands 
	  +, -, *, / and () precedence.  

2001-03-23 00:33  ejb

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- duh. i like |.  don't you like |? | are gooooooood.  

2001-03-23 00:30  ejb

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- support for saying '20 megabytes' and '5 hours' and such like 
	  in ircd.conf.  for some reason 'sendq=100;' to mean 100kb isn't 
	  working.. should be fixed before release.  

2001-03-21 22:51  ejb

	* include/send.h: 
	- commit send.h as well..  

2001-03-21 22:51  ejb

	* src/: channel.c, send.c: 
	- add sendto_match_vacap_servs(), and make set_channel_mode 
	  use it.  not tested yet ..  

2001-03-21 22:31  androsyn

	* modules/m_trace.c: Forgot an argument to inetntop() 

2001-03-21 22:29  androsyn

	* modules/m_trace.c: This should fix /trace for the IPv6 case..  

2001-03-21 19:57  ejb

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/md5.h, src/md5.c: 
	- turn uint32_t into u_int32_t and make configure check for it.  

2001-03-21 19:52  ejb

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- warn if user specified no $MAKE to configure..  

2001-03-21 19:13  ejb

	* configure, adns/Makefile.in, autoconf/configure.in,
	contrib/Makefile.in, iauth/source/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in: 
	- detect in configure how we should include files in Makefile.  
	  This isn't a perfect test, but it should work..  

2001-03-19 10:12  toot

	* modules/m_away.c: /away flood control was a bit harsh 

2001-03-19 08:49  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Adds our own definition of INADDR_LOOPBACK if it
	wasn't defined by the OS headers. Don't you love hacks around hacks.
	The first being the hack checking if the nameserver was 0.0.0.0, if
	so, set the nameserver to 127.0.0.1.  

2001-03-19 03:24  toot

	* include/: config.h, config.h.dist: restored some stuff in
	config.h that'd been changed..  and synced config.h.dist 

2001-03-19 02:59  toot

	* doc/example.conf, include/config.h, include/m_info.h,
	include/s_conf.h, modules/m_info.c, modules/core/m_quit.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: . moved

	* include/linebuf.h: 
	- This alleviates the high counts found in the block allocator in
	  profiles.  The problem was a # of block count that was set way too
	  low.  128 for BUF_BLOCK_SIZE means we allocate a bit map of 128 bits 
	  which means for many allocated linebufs, we end up with a series 
	  of smallish Block's with 128 bit maps...  
	  In reality, the block allocator should be rewritten to embed a 
	  "hint" into the allocated memory as to where the returned memory 
	  block should go. There are a few other easier to do optimizations 
	  as well. It has been pointed out that modern OS's have now caught
	  up and now use block allocation for malloc, if thats true, the
	  block allocator code might well be obsolete.  

2001-03-15 13:03  db

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_names.c, src/channel.c: 
	- print all channel member lists at once in names 
	  this hides somewhat better who the chanops are.  
	  Its not optimized at all at the moment, fact is its terrible.  
	  If someone optimizes it before me, great. I won't mind. ;)

	  core like ircnsprintf when its >reallen

	- moved oper_umodes (modes set on /oper) from config.h ->
	  example.conf with a check if there isnt one in the config..  
	- mebbe we should allow this per oper block on hyb7.1? 

2001-03-14 09:31  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd_devpoll.c: Fixed devpoll support so it would actually
	compile on Solaris.  I'm not sure if it works yet or not though.  

2001-03-13 22:27  toot

	* modules/m_gline.c, src/channel.c: . let halfops set +v and +k .
	  removed some unused variables, and moved one of trhe
	  PERSISTANT_CLIENT ifdefs to kill a compile warning ;) 

2001-03-13 16:52  davidt

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- Allow multiple user="..."; lines per auth{} block...  
	  (oper{}, etc. blocks can probably be changed to work the same way 
	   quite easily, I'll look at it tomorrow, to see what would
	   actually benefit from it) 

2001-03-13 15:35  ejb

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	- don't build m_error.c as a module, it has to be static for now.  

2001-03-13 13:42  fl_

	* include/config.h: 
	- ripped the flood bit out of config.h, also if they dont set a

	- added min_nonwildcard to config for the minimum real chars you
	  need for a gline/kline (remote/local) 
	- moved the set options below the config file reading in ircd.c 
	- instead of #define FLOODCOUNT in config.h.. we now set the default
	  on startup in the config.. I think ill try doing of much as this as
	  I can, so config.h gets smaller :) 

2001-03-13 09:41  adrian

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	src/Makefile.in, src/s_bsd_devpoll.c: 
	
	initial /dev/poll support, again ripped from my devpoll code in a 
	squid branch.  
	
	/dev/poll is the solaris solution to the suckiness of poll/select on
	large/active FD sets. Its kind of like kqueue but using a poll 
	interface. My (quick) tests show that its actually rather nifty with
	large FD sets, so this should make hybrid-7 Not Suck(tm) under 
	Solaris 7/8.  
	
	I believe there's a linux patchset to give the kernel /dev/poll, but
	I hear its crap. heh.  
	
	This code isn't guaranteed to even compile on a solaris box yet, but
	I wanted to get it in anyway. It doesn't break a "default" build (ie
	without --enable-devpoll). I promise to fix it in a few hours. :)

	src/messages.tab, src/packet.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- Fixed fl_'s revert and fixed the klines bug.  
	- Please not that persistant clients are temporarily back in, but
	  please don't try and remove them by reverting because I can
	  guarantee it will break more stuff than it fixes, like last time.
	  These things are best removed manually, as it is silly to revert
	  days of work for a little thing like a "hme" to should be a "hmc" as
	  one done last time. However, this being an open source project, we
	  probably don't want to actually hide our code from the public -
	how about if we go for: #ifdef PERSISTANT_CLIENTS #error Persistant
	clients aren't finished yet.  ...  #endif 
	 which should stop people defining but not block people from seeing
	 it. Furthermore, we should not so much as put a #undef
	 PERSISTANT_CLIENTS or /* #define PERSISTANT_CLIENTS */ in config.h
	 or anything, as that is just asking people to define it. Or we
	 could just manually delete them(which will be easy as they are all 
	wrapped in #ifdef PERSISTANT_CLIENTS except a few harmless things in
	the lexer/parser.  

2001-03-11 22:31  androsyn

	  * Tidied up TODO, it had a bunch of stuff in it that had already
	  been done.  
	* Multiple ports are now allowed per listen{} block.  
	    Note that host=""; lines must come before port=123; lines (they

	src/messages.tab, src/packet.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- This reverts the tree to its state on the 8th 
	
	  The main reason for this is to fix klines.. which were broken in a 
	  hostmask.c commit.. but finding out what was wrong wouldve been 
	  insane.. the patch is available of what ive changed to restore it 
	  back with persistant clients (which this removes), and the buggy 
	  kline stuff..  
	
	- We need a stable tree for beta3.. not a buggy one :/ 

2001-03-11 09:30  fl_

	* include/config.h: 
	- undefine persistant clients by default.. is there a missing

2001-03-11 03:21  fl_

	* include/m_kline.h, modules/m_kline.c:

2001-03-10 22:12  a1kmm

	* include/config.h, src/client.c, src/linebuf.c, src/packet.c: 
	- Got some basic reattaching to work, but it is not finished yet so
	  you may not want to have PERSISTANT_CLIENTS defined. We also need to
	decide what to send on reattach, as well as a nicer way of sending
	the id/key.  

2001-03-10 17:36  fl_

	* modules/m_gline.c:

2001-03-03 23:34  androsyn

	* README.FIRST: We don't need a functional system resolver anymore
	:) 

2001-03-03 07:13  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/README: Typo, thanks for spotting it Martin 

2001-03-02 12:35  fl_

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- added some TS rules to permanent channels..  
	  if a remote server sends users to a perm channel, we drop our
	  modes, and use theirs, else we are really going to break things..  
	
	  if they are bursting a perm channel, and we have one, use whoevers 
	  TS is older..  

2001-03-02 10:16  fl_

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- dont pass received sjoins on for persistant chans, to those not
	  using CAP_VCHAN.. do we need another cap? 

2001-03-02 09:20  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- Reset buf/sjbuf/sjbuf_nh to "" in m_sjoin, so we don't accidentaly 
	  reuse previous nicks....  

2001-03-02 01:45  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Fixed a potential buffer overflow where strncat is used
	incorrectly.  

2001-03-01 21:37  db

	* src/s_log.c: 
	- missing #ifdef USE_SYSLOG on #include 
	  replaced this for now  /* XXX #ifdef HAVE_SYSLOG_H */ 
	  Should this be in configure? 

2001-03-01 16:22  lusky

	* include/patchlevel.h: 
	- revved patchlevel to beta2 

2001-03-01 15:28  fl_

	* src/parse.c: 
	- removed the extra debug message for the numerics, as it shouldve 
	  been caught now 

2001-03-01 15:00  fl_

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- ok.. did it a different way, we only burst perm channels to those 
	  who support CAP_VCHAN, as older servers wont time them out 

2001-03-01 14:02  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	- reverted my patch, im gunna do it a different way 

2001-03-01 13:42  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	- this fixes the 403 stuff.. we now actually burst userless channels 
	  (could help stop desyncs), which stops us sending +b's for
	  non-existant channels..  
	
	  this doesnt break hyb6, but its revertable if it causes serious
	  problems 

2001-03-01 06:20  davidt

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Fix for a core on /rehash when removing in-use I lines.  

2001-03-01 06:14  androsyn

	* include/res.h: Forgot to commit res.h last night 

2001-02-28 23:46  androsyn

	* include/numeric.h, src/adns.c, src/messages.tab,
	modules/m_stats.c: Adds a /STATS A for listing the current set of
	DNS servers adns is using.  

2001-02-28 23:12  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: this lets adns process timeouts correctly.  

2001-02-28 23:02  db

	* src/memory.c: 
	- can't use mem_frob if NDEBUG is defined 

2001-02-28 22:04  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Gets rid of the dns lookup in listener.c it was a
	dumb idea..if you ask me :P 

2001-02-28 21:21  db

	* modules/m_eob.c: 
	- grrr calculate a delta , if its reasonable use it.  
	  Otherwise, report 0. blah.  
	  The =proper= fix is to store the TS delta from the svinfo 
	  into the server struct for that server.  

2001-02-28 20:06  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: This should fix the /rehash coredump..  

2001-02-28 17:44  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- fixed misc I lines/klines so *@* now works again.  

2001-02-28 12:27  fl_

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- put back the 502 numeric (cant change modes for other users) 
	- put back the warning about servers changing our usermodes 
	
	these were commented out.. but I dont see why: noticed by jv 

2001-02-27 23:01  androsyn

	* src/Makefile.in: Doh..i'm a tard 

2001-02-27 22:58  androsyn

	* src/Makefile.in: Fixed yacc for real this time :) 

2001-02-27 22:55  androsyn

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure, src/Makefile.in: Makes
	yacc/bison detection work right.  

2001-02-27 22:34  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Well..this fixes that core dump..The problem is now
	that I lines don't seem to be working right :/ 

2001-02-27 21:51  ejb

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, modules/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in: 
	- fixes to make compile on solaris using sunsoft cc work.  
	  tested compile, and it loads the module fine, but i haven't 
	  checked that it works any more than that.  

2001-02-27 16:50  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- don't try to use a flag on a NULL pointer 

2001-02-26 23:17  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/config.h, include/setup.h.in: Made IPv6 a configure option 

2001-02-26 21:46  androsyn

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/setup.h.in, src/Makefile.in, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c,
	src/s_bsd_poll.c, src/s_bsd_select.c: Minor change to the build
	system so that s_bsd_*.c will always generate an .o file, but are
	empty for the loop type you're not using. Makes for slightly cleaner
	makefiles.  

2001-02-26 14:17  fl_

	* modules/m_eob.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- This fixes EOB timing.. we rely on the remote server to calculate 
	  the time spent, may be some issues with TS deltas which ill fix
	  later 

2001-02-26 11:37  androsyn

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure: Half a fix for Sun's CC.  

2001-02-26 11:04  androsyn

	* src/: hostmask.c, s_bsd.c: Fixes for Sun's CC. Things actually
	compile now with it.  

2001-02-26 10:27  androsyn

	* adns/: event.c, general.c, internal.h, parse.c, query.c, types.c: 
	Fixed things so that they compile without warning with Sun's CC.  
	BTW, Sun's CC sucks.  

2001-02-26 06:51  ejb

	* README.FIRST, src/Makefile.in, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- fix to make ircd_parser.y work 
	- notes on Solaris compile.  

2001-02-26 06:21  db

	* src/: client.c, tools.c: 
	- don't frob memory if NDEBUG is set 

2001-02-26 00:01  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: memory.h was in the wrong place with MEMDEBUG set.  

2001-02-25 23:53  androsyn

	* include/listener.h, include/res.h, include/s_auth.h, src/adns.c,
	src/client.c, src/listener.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/s_conf.c: More updates to adns.  Using the block allocator for
	struct DNSQuery now.  

2001-02-25 22:59  androsyn

	* src/listener.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, include/client.h,
	include/fdlist.h, include/s_auth.h, include/s_conf.h: Minor
	interface change to adns.  Basically we have the callbacks freeing 
	memory for the struct DNSQuery in the callbacks.  I should probably
	modify this to use the block allocator.  

2001-02-25 16:59  jdc

	* src/listener.c: 
	* Here we go again.  ;-) Fixes to make /STATS P not show the same 
	  listening port twice after a /REHASH, and make things all clean 
	  and happy on BSD: 
	
	  listener.c: In function `inetport': 
	  listener.c:194: invalid lvalue in assignment 
	  listener.c: In function `find_listener': 
	  listener.c:247: warning: passing arg 1 of `memcmp' makes pointer
	  from integer without a cast listener.c:247: warning: passing arg 2
	of `memcmp' makes pointer from integer without a cast 

2001-02-25 16:28  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Uncommentted fixed code 

2001-02-25 16:25  androsyn

	* doc/example.conf: Documented listen {} host=".." fix.  

2001-02-25 16:20  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Fixed host="ipaddress" in listen {} blocks for
	IPv6.  

2001-02-25 15:58  androsyn

	* src/s_bsd.c: Error condition for inetpton() should be <= 0 :) 

2001-02-25 15:50  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Fixed broken /rehash dns 

2001-02-25 15:30  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Fixed more weirdness..this was from my half assed
	attempt at fixing /dns rehash 

2001-02-25 15:29  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Fixed weird dns bug..  

2001-02-25 15:12  androsyn

	* src/s_conf.c: Remember that for inetpton() that is <= 0 is an
	error condition not just == 0 

2001-02-25 14:48  androsyn

	* configure: Without libresolv checks..  

2001-02-25 14:48  androsyn

	* autoconf/configure.in: Removed libresolv/libnsl checks from
	configure.in 

2001-02-25 14:45  androsyn

	* adns/: general.c, types.c: These are really that last ones for
	libresolv. Now I just need to figure out how to make autoconf not
	look for libresolv and libnsl 

2001-02-25 14:43  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Fixed yet another dependancy on libresolv 

2001-02-25 14:41  androsyn

	* adns/event.c: Fixed another dependancy of libresolv on solaris 

2001-02-25 14:34  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Fixed stupid typo..  

2001-02-25 14:29  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Removed inet_aton() calls.  This should be the last
	things that needs libresolv on solaris.  

2001-02-25 14:25  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Further fixes to listen {} blocks for adns
	stuff...  

2001-02-25 12:31  jdc

	* include/listener.h, src/listener.c: CVS prior to now would not
	compile on FreeBSD.  So here are my fixes.  If any of this is wrong,
	someone please fix it.  This isn't code I should be playing with in
	the first place, but it seems to work...  
	
	* include/listener.h 
	    Changed Listener 'addr' def. from struct in_addr to irc_inaddr.  
	* src/listener.c 
	    make_listener(): copy_s_addr() needed to be changed due to the 
	      include/listener.h change.  
	    inetport(): lsin.sin_addr assignment needed to be changed (used 
	      memcpy() to be safe; used inet6 stuff as example).  
	    find_listener(): Changed PIN_ADDR() and IN_ADDR() to &PIN_ADDR() 
	      and &IN_ADDR().  More importantly, memcmp() logic was
	      backwards I think -- result was /REHASH, then /STATS P showing
	      two of the same listening ports; changed to (!memcmp()).  

2001-02-25 03:28  androsyn

	* src/: adns.c, listener.c: Fixed a few minor bugs I
	introduced...ipv6 vhost listeners almost work. They re scribbling
	over the listener port right now.. I don't think this happens for
	IPv4 but I haven't checked either.  

2001-02-25 02:58  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Made listener.c use adns instead of
	gethostbyaddr() which should kill the last of the libresolv code. 
	Also I think I've fixed vhosting for IPv6, but alas I have not
	tested this just yet.  

2001-02-25 02:39  toot

	* include/s_serv.h: reduced startup_connections_time from 5mins to
	1min surely that's long enough? :) 

2001-02-25 01:49  androsyn

	* adns/setup.c: Forgot a htonl() 

2001-02-25 01:42  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Second half of dns rehash fix. This actually works
	now.  

2001-02-25 01:41  androsyn

	* adns/: setup.c, adns.h: First half of the dns rehash fixes. Also
	fixed for a case where a nameserver is 0.0.0.0. We alter the address
	to be 127.0.0.1 in that case.  

2001-02-24 15:19  jdc

	* messages/translations/ircd-dutch.po: Typo a la Riedel (gewijgerd
	--> geweigerd).  

2001-02-24 09:01  wcampbel

	* BUGS, doc/example.conf, messages/translations/README: Spell
	checked all these files 

2001-02-24 07:25  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/: README, ircd-norwegian.po: Proper
	credits, added the norwegian translation (currently broken sigh) 

2001-02-24 07:14  fl_

	* messages/translations/: Makefile.in, ircd-dutch.po: 
	- Added riedel's ircd-dutch.po translation to the tree, updated
	makefile 

2001-02-24 06:36  toot

	* include/modules.h, src/ircd_parser.y, src/modules.c: fixed
	modules="..."; in ircd.conf 

2001-02-24 05:16  toot

	* src/ircd_parser.y: fixed a little typo in ircd_parser.y with
	client_exit option 

2001-02-24 01:06  a1kmm

	* include/config.h: 
	- Make sure we get the right version of config.h 

2001-02-23 22:32  a1kmm

	* include/: config.h, memory.h: 
	- Disable memory debugging for the beta release.  

2001-02-23 19:58  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/: Makefile.in, README, ircd-spanish.po: 
	Added the spanish translation, submitted by ermak and corrected by
	xfrob (both from Hybnet) 

2001-02-23 16:36  a1kmm

	* src/: client.c, hostmask.c, parse.c: 
	- Fixed glines.  
	- Fixed parse.c so exit_client it is only called once.  
	- Fixed exit_client so we don't set the client dead until we have
	sent the contents of the sendq.  

2001-02-23 14:21  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Removed an assert which simply shouldn't be there.  

2001-02-23 13:49  wcampbel

	* TODO, doc/index.txt: Updated my TODO list Added madmax's cookies
	proposal 

2001-02-23 12:02  wcampbel

	* BUGS, messages/translations/Makefile.in,
	messages/translations/README, messages/translations/ircd-danish.po: 
	Xride submitted the Danish translation, set that up in the
	translations Makefile.  Also documented in BUGS that you have to set
	the msglocale to standard before trying to update one in use, as it
	will occasionally dump core.  

2001-02-23 10:22  fl_

	* modules/core/m_quit.c: 
	- we dont need mo_oper(), an !IsOper() check is better :) 

2001-02-22 22:45  db

	* src/: list.c, packet.c, parse.c, send.c: 
	- This appears to be stable under seans little "toy" test cloner.  
	  I have moved the exit_client code outside of send.c and into
	  parse.c for now. Not sure if this is =quite= the right place but
	  I'd like to sleep tonight.  
	
	  Anyway, a more optimum solution will be to fd_close in dead_socket()
	  I think and then mark the fd as -1 .. but I don't want to deal
	with it tonight.  
	
	  Oh, I'm not sure if cptr after handle_command() in parse.c needs to
	  be checked as well.  

2001-02-22 18:36  wcampbel

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: Fix configure to properly find
	and set the @RANLIB@ variable.  

2001-02-22 17:31  fl_

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- dont flood limit remote clients..  
	  in doing this however.. we dont actually need to check if the
	  client is flooding or not.. it seems a waste just to generate an
	error message.  
	- dont flood limit opers in private, in channels where theyre
	  unopped, they shouldnt be given preferential treatment, so limit
	them with users 
	- RFC says we dont reply to notices.. if a client is flooding with a 
	  notice, dont tell them theyre message didnt arrive 

2001-02-22 13:48  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/README: Edited the readme some more 

2001-02-22 13:24  fl_

	* messages/custom.po, messages/translations/ircd-croatian.po,
	messages/translations/ircd-german.po,
	messages/translations/ircd-swedish.po, src/messages.tab: 
	- added the +l usermode to the 004 numeric 

2001-02-22 13:01  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/Makefile.in: Ok, rename complete,
	swedish.po -> ircd-swedish.po and so on 

2001-02-22 12:43  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/ircd-german.po: Fixed the German
	translation.  I WILL be renaming things in the repository as gettext
	appears to die with 'german' or 'swedish' 

2001-02-22 12:39  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: I forgot to commit some stuff. Part of the /dns
	rehash fixes..well half-fix at least.  

2001-02-22 11:04  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/: Makefile.in, README, ircd-croatian.po,
	ircd-german.po: Added the working Croatian translation, and a
	broken German translation (I will fix the German one soon) and gave
	credit where credit is due 

2001-02-21 07:07  androsyn

	* src/client.c: Fixed stupid misteak in last commit...  

2001-02-21 06:55  androsyn

	* src/s_auth.c, src/s_conf.c, src/client.c, include/res.h: Misc
	adns cleanups.  Half way to getting /dns rehash working again 

2001-02-20 23:59  androsyn

	* src/listener.c: Minor fix replacing close() with fd_close() 

2001-02-20 22:13  db

	* src/packet.c: 
	- flush queues if client is marked dead.  

2001-02-20 20:07  wcampbel

	* messages/: custom.po, translations/Makefile.in,
	translations/ircd-swedish.po: Updates in the messages stuff 

2001-02-20 19:05  wcampbel

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in,
	messages/translations/Makefile.in,
	messages/translations/ircd-swedish.po: Updated (and corrected one
	small glitch in) swedish.po, created the Makefile.in for it, and
	added it to autoconf 

2001-02-20 18:52  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/ircd-swedish.po: Added trbz's Swedish
	translation 

2001-02-20 17:26  wcampbel

	* messages/translations/README: Revised custom.po, Added the README
	for the translations.  I'll create a Makefile (might need help) to
	install a specific language, and to do maintainance on each .po
	file.  Any contributions will be appreciated 

2001-02-20 16:22  davidt

	* src/: packet.c, s_bsd.c, s_serv.c, send.c: 
	- Missed test in src/packet.c, while( <get line from sendq> ) should 
	  check the client hasn't died before parsing the line..  
	- Oddness in s_serv.c -- random garbage was being copied into
	  fd_note, whilst the correctly copied string was being completely
	ignored...  

2001-02-20 06:13  wcampbel

	* include/config.h: Make one of the define's easier to read 

2001-02-20 02:43  toot

	* modules/core/m_mode.c: took out an unneeded if() in m_mode.c 

2001-02-20 02:25  toot

	* include/vchannel.h, modules/core/m_mode.c, modules/core/m_part.c,
	src/vchannel.c: use find_bchan instead of map_bchan.  it's much
	quicker.  

2001-02-19 21:14  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf, messages/custom.po: Cleaned up an unclear
	sentence in example.conf, and updated the messages file.  Someone
	want to write user docs on the messages stuff? 

2001-02-18 18:54  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: ip="..."; in listen {} is
	inconsistent, like a connect {} host entry, it can accept both IP's
	and hostnames, so it should be host="..."; Also we had complaints
	about needing " " here, while all other ip= lines do not use the " " 

2001-02-17 22:44  wcampbel

	* Hybrid-team, Makefile.in, TODO, doc/Makefile.in,
	doc/example.conf, doc/index.txt, doc/ircd.8,
	doc/server-version-info, doc/whats-new.txt, include/config.h,
	src/s_debug.c, tools/rsa_respond/Makefile,
	tools/rsa_respond/README: 
	1.  Update the TODO list 
	2.  Massive update of the docs for the (hopefully soon) beta2
	release.  
	3.  Made the rsa_respond/Makefile consistent 
	4.  Cleaned up make rsa_respond from the source root somewhat 
	5.  make install in doc/ installs the manpage (now that it's
	    reasonably up to date) to man8 in the prefix.  
	6.  Removed the last vestiges of CRYPT_LINK_PASSWORD 
	7.  Last but not least, added vulture to the credits as a
	contributer 

2001-02-16 21:44  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Fixed /rehash dns finally.  Boy I'm awful lazy these
	days :P 

2001-02-16 20:53  db

	* adns/query.c: 
	- ok... MyMalloc() does not memset memory to 0, and we are seeing 
	  0xdeadbeef errors... sooo I want to see it fail with NULL's at
	  least easier to fix then.  

2001-02-16 17:37  a1kmm

	* include/hostmask.h, src/hostmask.c, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_conf.c: 
	- Reverted db's patch - we must not free I-lines a client is
	attached to.  
	- Added some documentation to the functions.  
	- Added some ugly debug code in case the reason that the reverted
	  patch was needed shows up again, so we get more useful cores.  

2001-02-16 10:37  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- oops. reporting the wrong things for Klines. fixed.  

2001-02-16 10:22  db

	* include/hostmask.h, src/hostmask.c: 
	- cleaned up hostmask.c clear_conf() there is no need to keep 
	  a separate link list at all 
	- note register is deprecated or ignored with any modern compiler.  

2001-02-16 09:42  ejb

	- fix for /quote accept -nick flooding 

2001-02-16 07:36  db

	* modules/m_kline.c, src/s_conf.c:

	  and not freeing ConfItem's on failure.  

2001-02-15 21:27  db

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- stop nnn.nnn.*.* type dlines at the pass...  

2001-02-14 22:16  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c:

	- also changed /msg opers@ to use local wallops 

2001-02-14 21:43  androsyn

	* adns/: event.c, setup.c: Fixed adns to use close() to use
	fd_close() 

2001-02-14 21:39  androsyn

	* src/: adns.c, s_conf.c: The resolver will now actually reread
	/etc/resolv.conf.  Also note that this pretty much does a full
	restart on the resolver.  

2001-02-14 19:01  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf, include/config.h: Add +l (locops) to the
	default oper umodes Fix a typo in example.conf Document fakename
	(server hostmasking nonsense) in example.conf 

2001-02-14 13:07  fl_

	  $$irc.server has been reverted to $irc.server to keep
	  compatability I need to go shout at my isp so ill fix $# soon :) 

2001-02-14 00:22  a1kmm

	* include/memory.h, src/hostmask.c: 
	- Made the special case of hostmasks with no wildcards work
	properly.  

2001-02-13 23:55  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- somehow this fix got blown away accidentally...  
	  puts the right ip into the aconf if hostname happens to be an IP 

2001-02-13 22:58  a1kmm

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	- Use memset instead of bzero in an attempt to reduce the number of

2001-02-13 22:53  toot

	* adns/check.c, adns/dlist.h, adns/event.c, adns/general.c,

	more denys . made some formatting more consistent :P 

2001-02-13 22:14  a1kmm

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- Re-reverted something I accidently reverted - always close all
	  files in your text-editor after cvs update! 

2001-02-13 21:54  a1kmm

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- Finally that ConfItem memory leak seems to have gone - we now free
	  ip_ilines and even the associated conf items.  

2001-02-13 21:46  androsyn

	* adns/internal.h: Fixed adns for non gcc compilers.  

2001-02-13 02:03  db

	* TODO: 
	- updated TODO list 

2001-02-13 01:46  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Slightly better clear_conf code - there was actually a risk of
	  double free before. Still we have that memory leak however :( 

2001-02-13 01:34  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- don't increment scount unless it was successfully added 

2001-02-13 01:08  db

	* src/: s_bsd.c, s_conf.c: 
	- fixed IP in conf when ip is used for host = ""; in connect block 
	  use inetpton() on given string, if returns 0 use dns... otherwise 
	  its a valid IP to use. s_conf.c 
	
	- open fd to stderr.log, dup it to fd 2 s_bsd.c 

2001-02-12 22:22  androsyn

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_serv.c: Made server hostmasking work again.  Well, at least
	in theory.  Added a fakename= option to the connect block for this.  

2001-02-12 20:16  androsyn

	* src/s_conf.c: This fixes it properly this time :P 

2001-02-12 20:13  androsyn

	* src/s_conf.c: This is the IPV6 half of that fix..  

2001-02-12 20:00  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- this fixes the IP showing on /connect for =now= AndroSyn will have 
	  to tidy this up...  

2001-02-12 08:02  jdc

	* include/s_conf.h: 
	- Logic for spoof_notice was backwards.  Oops.  

2001-02-12 07:56  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- make it compile at least for now 

2001-02-12 00:23  androsyn

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_conf.c: Free allocated memory from
	adns. Dumb bugs..  

2001-02-11 23:44  a1kmm

	* include/memory.h, src/memory.c: 
	- Re-added that code to stop malloc() etc... getting in.  

2001-02-11 22:29  androsyn

	* adns/: internal.h, query.c, setup.c: adns using stat as a local
	variable seems to be a dumb idea...  

2001-02-11 22:13  androsyn

	* src/listener.c, src/s_bsd.c, include/s_bsd.h: Fixed some brain
	damage on incoming connections...the code has been changed to make
	it more friendly to ipv6.  

2001-02-11 21:24  db

	* adns/general.c: 
	- modified logging in adns functions to work with ircd s_log 
	  bit of a quick hack for now ;-/ 

2001-02-11 16:37  db

	* adns/adns.h, adns/check.c, adns/event.c, adns/general.c,
	adns/internal.h, adns/parse.c, adns/query.c, adns/reply.c,
	adns/setup.c, adns/transmit.c, adns/types.c, include/res.h,
	src/adns.c: 
	- reworked adns to not use fgetc, fprintf and friends, but the ircd 
	  specific FBFILE library (fileio.h) 
	- removed duplicated redundant #include "memory.h" 

2001-02-11 12:20  db

	* include/memory.h, src/memory.c: 
	- removed apparent debugging code left in 

2001-02-11 01:28  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Put deleted hostmask confs on a list so we can free them later.
	  Still leaves some memory leaks somewhere in the config(but why?) but
	it is partway there...  

2001-02-10 23:06  a1kmm

	* adns/event.c, adns/general.c, adns/query.c, adns/reply.c,
	adns/setup.c, include/memory.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/memory.c: 
	- Fixed adns to use My* memory functions.  

2001-02-10 20:09  androsyn

	* adns/: adns.h, event.c, general.c, query.c, reply.c, setup.c: 
	Fixed adns/ to use MyMalloc() instead of malloc() 

2001-02-10 19:52  a1kmm

	* include/memory.h, src/client.c, src/fdlist.c, src/hook.c,
	src/hostmask.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/modules.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Some general tidyups to help catch memory leaks and other
	  problems, like changing calls to calloc and malloc and strdup to
	MyMalloc, + a few memory leak fixes. Still some more to go, however.  

2001-02-10 17:51  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Fixed IP I/K lines to work properly, but we still have to put IP I
	  lines and normal I lines on the same precedence scheme.  

2001-02-10 16:33  fl_

	* src/parse.c: 
	- added extra logging for numerics sent to servers.. this should 
	  be removed once we fix the causes of it (admin only for now) 

2001-02-10 15:51  a1kmm

	* src/listener.c: 
	- Fixed DLINES - an irc_inaddr is not the same as a sockaddr 
	- We cannot return from accept_connection without re-selecting the
	  listener or the listener won't work properly! 

2001-02-10 15:01  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- /rehash should check_klines() ! 

2001-02-10 12:33  wcampbel

	* BUGS: Document the permissions bug on /etc/resolv.conf 

2001-02-10 11:24  fl_

	* doc/technical/send.txt: 
	- sendto_realops_flags_oper became sendto_wallops_flags() :) 

2001-02-10 07:06  jdc

	* src/listener.c: 
	- *Server name* being reported on connect was listener->name, not 
	  me.name.  

2001-02-10 06:26  jdc

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- Fixed bug where /WHO *, /WHO NICK, and /WHO #chan would not show 
	  +o or +v clients when opped or +h'd; bug was due to lack-of 
	  is_any_op() check alongside MODE_HIDEOPS.  
	- Changed variable name reference 'oper' to 'server_oper' to avoid 
	  confusion with chanops.  

2001-02-10 01:31  db

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- the hash table better be cleared as well 

2001-02-10 01:20  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- This should fix the pesky asserts once and for all.  
	  Remember the client struct hasnt' been freed yet, so its cool
	  here.  

2001-02-10 00:17  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- Reverted back to scanning forward in hostmask.c - the idea of
	  scanning backwards and not hashing the string seems to take more
	  clockcycles on the average hostname to get everything right than
	  just rehashing the string each time, since we have a relatively
	  good hash function(So we have to hash about 5 strings when a client
	  connects, but it isn't that bad). And we should also get rid of a
	  few special cases that were messing up k-lines and spoofs before.  

2001-02-08 20:15  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: Minor update of example.conf 

2001-02-08 19:51  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- argh I always test before committing. right? 

2001-02-08 19:20  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- anytime we get a socket connect error, the client should be marked 
	  with DEAD_SOCKET.. found by vulture.  

2001-02-08 15:59  db

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	- this at least prevents exit_client from exiting an already dead
	client twice.  

2001-02-08 00:30  db

	* src/listener.c: 
	- if an fd from accept is -1 don't add it ! 

2001-02-07 23:07  androsyn

	* adns/general.c: Keeps adns from splattering crud on fd=2 

2001-02-07 22:50  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: should use irccmp rather than strcmp when
	checking vchan_id 

2001-02-07 22:36  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: wasn't checking vchan_id for root channels..  

2001-02-07 21:56  a1kmm

	* src/hostmask.c: 
	- That "bogus //" that Hwy changed to /*  shouldn't be there at all
	- the code is needed for klines to work.  

2001-02-07 17:00  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- This fixes testline... find_tkline can be handed a NULL ip from
	testline.  

2001-02-07 16:07  wcampbel

	* src/hostmask.c: More bogus C++ // comments 

2001-02-07 10:18  wcampbel

	* src/client.c: Replaced bogus C++ // comment 

2001-02-07 07:27  wcampbel

	* TODO, doc/example.conf: Updated the TODO list kline=yes|no; in
	the conf controls KILL too 

2001-02-07 01:33  db

	* include/linebuf.h, src/client.c, src/linebuf.c: 
	- ok. once a client has exited, any recvq linebufs it has, must be
	  flushed else client_dopacket() will try to parse stuff while the
	  client has a -1 fd... oops. The old code (before david cleaned it
	  up) swept this under the carpet by simply ignoring the buffer if the
	  fd < 0 Sooo instead exit_client() should flush all recvq linebufs
	  when it exits a client. I added a new interface client_flush_input()
	  to linebuf.c I don't think client.c should be diddling directly with
	  linebuf_donebuf but thats just me.  

2001-02-07 00:14  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- one line comments aren't generally useful in fixing bugs.  
	  THIS fixes the stack smash observed on dead links 

2001-02-06 23:16  androsyn

	* src/s_auth.c: This *should* fix the long hostname bug..Untested
	however 

2001-02-05 23:10  androsyn

	* src/s_conf.c: Yup..that fix was okay..  

2001-02-05 21:50  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- this fixes a stack smash when a socket goes dead, you CANNOT 
	  ever try to send more stuff at it, or it goes into a nice nasty 
	  loop as it tries to send an error to the dead socket...  
	  There may be a better way of doing this.  

2001-02-05 19:17  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: connect { aftype = ipv4|ipv6; }; documented 

2001-02-05 17:14  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- temporary fix for adns /rehash cores 

2001-02-05 15:12  davidt

	* modules/core/m_mode.c: oops, missed a return 

2001-02-05 15:00  androsyn

	* src/adns.c: Keeps adns from dumping core on us.  This needs to be
	fix.  

2001-02-05 14:40  androsyn

	* adns/: event.c, setup.c: Fixed a bug with TCP sockets for

	- flags is not the same as status.  

2001-02-03 21:33  a1kmm

	* include/hostmask.h, modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_kline.c,
	modules/m_stats.c, modules/m_testline.c, modules/m_unkline.c,
	src/Makefile.in, src/hostmask.c, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/list.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_gline.c: 
	- Got rid of mtrie_conf, we now have new hashtable orientated code
	that should be faster on servers with lots of k-lines & I-lines
	etc...  

2001-02-03 17:50  wcampbel

	* Makefile.in, doc/challenge.txt, tools/rsa_respond/README: . make
	rsa_respond will create a distributable rsa_respond.tar.gz . Rewrote
	the rsa_respond README file . Removed buffer.c and buffer.h from
	  rsa_respond, they were old code, needed for rsa_respond.c.  The new
	  genkey/respond programs do not use these two files.  . Corrected my
	  spelling in challenge.txt... Do NOT document when you are tired Hwy! 

2001-02-03 13:41  wcampbel

	* BUGS: Documented that ::1 is not a supported IP (reported by me
	and poptix) 

2001-02-03 09:02  db

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- removed unused parameter in do_who() (chptr) 
	- removed duplicate #include "common.h" 

2001-02-03 07:51  wcampbel

	* TODO, doc/index.txt: Documented a few more things that were fixed
	from the TODO file Updated index.txt 

2001-02-02 22:49  db

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- after re-reading rfc1489 a bit, and the original tortured code 
	  by avalon I think this is what was meant. I think. I'll have to 
	  try a h6 server to verify.  

2001-02-02 21:49  wcampbel

	* INSTALL, doc/challenge.txt: Cleaned up INSTALL a little Added
	documentation for the challenge/response system 

2001-02-02 21:05  a1kmm

	* tools/rsa_respond/respond.c: 
	- Okay, this is under GPL not LGPL.  

2001-02-02 21:02  a1kmm

	* tools/rsa_respond/respond.c: 
	- Reapply Hwys changes I accidentally overwrote before(argc < 3 not
	argc < 2) 
	- umask says what you don't want not the default modes! 

2001-02-02 20:46  a1kmm

	* tools/rsa_respond/: Makefile, respond.c: 
	- More secure encryption of private keys that genkey/respond uses.  

2001-02-02 20:19  davidt

	* src/ircd_parser.y: Uhm.  I tested this... and it worked.. but
	this code couldn't work.. uhm. oops.  

2001-02-02 20:17  db

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- This is a better m_who follows the RFC closer I think 

2001-02-02 20:02  wcampbel

	* doc/whats-new.txt: Fixed an unclear sentence, found by caf@EFnet 

2001-02-02 19:55  davidt

	* src/Makefile.in: oops, only link SELECT_SRC in once...  

2001-02-02 19:51  davidt

	* include/config.h, modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	- Fix problem with assert() failure in ReadMessageFile...  
	  It was caused by only generating dependency information for the
	  current select method -- if you used kqueue, and the .depend file
	  was for poll, changes to s_bsd_kqueue's headers wouldn't recompile
	it...  

2001-02-02 19:39  wcampbel

	* tools/rsa_respond/respond.c: Don't core if we don't have the
	challenge parameter 

2001-02-02 19:38  davidt

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/config.h: -I flags
	should be in CPPFLAGS, not CFLAGS, updated configure to stop warning
	from make depend 

2001-02-02 18:59  jdc

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Blah.  Okay, *finally* fixed passwords.  I shouldn't have changed 
	  the strcmp()s like I did earlier.  The *REAL* bug was that one of 
	  the sendto_one()'s was sending aconf->passwd, not spasswd.  
	- Encrypted passwords are still up in the air, but they might work.  
	  Someone please try them, or work with me regarding it.  

2001-02-02 18:13  jdc

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Attempt #2...  God this stuff is evil! 
	- Fixed bug where connect failed when send_password and
	  accept_password were not identical.  strcmp aconf->spasswd, not
	aconf->passwd.  
	- The above fix might also (havent tested) fix encrypted password
	links.  

2001-02-02 17:33  jdc

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- Fixed bug where connect failed when send_password and
	  accept_password were not identical.  strcmp aconf->spasswd, not
	aconf->passwd.  
	- The above fix might also (havent tested) fix encrypted password
	links.  

2001-02-02 13:22  wcampbel

	* modules/m_who.c: m_who fix, not perfect, but it doesn't core now.  

2001-02-02 03:07  a1kmm

	* include/config.h, modules/core/m_mode.c: 
	- "mode #channel !vchan [+...]" now works.  

2001-02-02 01:36  a1kmm

	* include/client.h, modules/m_challenge.c, modules/m_oper.c,
	src/rsa.c, src/s_user.c, tools/rsa_respond/Makefile,

	- The challenge command finally works.  

2001-02-01 14:49  jdc

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- Removed initialization from incompatible pointer type warning due 
	  to line 483.  Forced type as (char *).  

2001-02-01 14:34  jdc

	* BUGS: 
	- module="" directive in modules {} block does not load module on
	startup.  

2001-01-31 13:15  davidt

	* doc/example.conf, include/config.h, include/s_conf.h,
	modules/m_info.c, modules/core/m_message.c, src/channel.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Fix missing space between parabuf and : in channel.c 
	- Fix missing if(p_or_n != NOTICE) in m_message.c, allowing an
	  infinite loop of +g messages to DoS the server..  
	- Added caller_id_wait to remove 60 second hardcoded time between +g 
	  notifications.  

2001-01-31 02:13  jdc

	* TODO: 
	- Added myself into the TODO list.  Gee, don't I feel special? 

2001-01-30 23:06  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- fixed tiny bug that broke /msg $#host.mask messages for opers 

2001-01-30 21:58  jdc

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- Fixed valid_comment() usage (didn't see line 691).  Now #ifndef
	  IPV6 is used to get rid of the -Wunused warning.  Someone should fix
	  this kludge properly before a final release.  

2001-01-30 21:53  jdc

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- Removed aconf->ip = IN_ADDR(ip); warnings (force unsigned long).  
	- Commented out valid_comment function (unused so far?).  

2001-01-30 13:34  davidt

	* modules/m_userhost.c: oops, fix core caused by previous change 

2001-01-30 13:16  davidt

	* modules/m_userhost.c: fix userhost for lazylinks 

2001-01-30 12:11  fl_

	* BUGS, include/client.h, modules/core/m_server.c, src/client.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c, src/send.c: 
	- added FLAGS_NOTADMIN and removed as many of the double notices as 
	  I could.. I might have missed some though :) 

2001-01-30 11:26  fl_

	* contrib/m_clearchan.c, contrib/m_jupe.c, contrib/m_opme.c,
	include/send.h, modules/m_connect.c, modules/m_locops.c,
	modules/m_operwall.c, modules/m_wallops.c, modules/core/m_squit.c,
	src/send.c: 
	- changed sendto_realops_flags_opers() -> sendto_wallops_flags() 
	  it makes much more sense like that :) 
	- removed an unneeded if() from sendto_wallops_flags() 

2001-01-30 07:53  wcampbel

	* modules/m_operwall.c: Removed "OPERWALL - " from in front of the
	OPERWALL message...  This may be exerting my opinion...but the two
	commands do the same damn thing, why should they look any different?
	Other than "elite-ness", I don't see any reason why OPERWALL should
	exist at all.  

2001-01-29 12:04  jdc

	* src/s_bsd.c: Typo fix (FLAGS_ADMINS --> FLAGS_ADMIN).  

2001-01-29 11:59  jdc

	* modules/: m_stats.c, core/m_server.c, core/m_squit.c, m_svinfo.c,
	m_trace.c: Changed all get_client_name() references, respectively,
	from TRUE/FALSE to SHOW_IP/HIDE_IP.  Also changed HIDEME to MASK_IP.  
	
	Also, forgot to mention this: 
	
	src/s_bsd.c and src/s_serv.c were modified earlier to send two 
	sendto_realops_flags() notices, one for admins (with SHOW_IP) and
	one for opers (with HIDE_IP).  This means admins will get two
	notices during a connect/disconnect, but I digress.  

2001-01-29 11:52  jdc

	* src/: client.c, m_error.c, parse.c, s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_misc.c,
	s_serv.c, s_user.c, send.c: Changed all get_client_name()
	references, respectively, from TRUE/FALSE to SHOW_IP/HIDE_IP.  Also
	changed HIDEME to MASK_IP.  

2001-01-29 11:37  db

	* include/client.h, src/send.c: 
	- simplified sendto_realops_flags(FLAGS_ALL... case 

2001-01-29 11:09  wcampbel

	* doc/whats-new.txt: Removed CAPAB DE from the docs 

2001-01-29 10:58  db

	* include/s_serv.h, src/channel.c: 
	- removed all reference to CAP_DE its GONE GONE GONE yay 
	  removed modebuf_de pbuf_de etc.  

2001-01-29 08:09  wcampbel

	* README.FIRST, doc/example.conf: Minor documentation cleanup 

2001-01-28 22:09  lusky

	* include/patchlevel.h: revved patchlevel to beta1 

2001-01-28 19:53  wcampbel

	* src/modules.c: Applied the OpenBSD a.out fix Someone test this to
	make sure it still runs right on BSD/Linux/Solaris...  

2001-01-28 19:08  ejb

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/s_serv.c: OOH YES YES YES 
	YES "$"*( YES !!!!!!! OOOOOOOOH YES.  
	
	um sorry.  
	
	- removed sea^H^H^H+d s^U 
	- removed +d support, as it causes more problems than it solves.  

2001-01-28 16:34  jdc

	* src/parse.c: msg_hash_table bug (MAX_MSG_HASH+10 vs.
	MAX_MSG_HASH) seems to be gone; do some more testing on this one,
	but it's not showing up like in hybrid-6.  

2001-01-28 16:17  jdc

	* modules/m_away.c: No throttling/"load" check for opers when
	setting /AWAY.  

2001-01-28 16:07  jdc

	* modules/m_userhost.c: Grumble grumble.  Put the code back in;
	apparently mIRC and others use the "feature" to obtain the clients'
	local IP.  This is needed for backwards compatibility.  

2001-01-28 16:06  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- dont burst users to the server that the user is on 
	- removed useless IsOper() check 
	- this should be the last commit for a while :) 

2001-01-28 15:44  jdc

	* modules/m_userhost.c: Commented out code which returns the actual
	IP when a user/client does a USERHOST on itself.  Seems pointless to
	me.  Return whatever the server says your host is.  

2001-01-28 15:21  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- more minor fixes :) 

2001-01-28 14:11  davidt

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: Fix kill for certain LL situations...  

2001-01-28 13:33  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- this renders kill_client() redundant, but basically we werent
	  sending kills to every server, which was causing problems with hyb6
	  as we could introduce a nick twice..  
	- we now use sendto_cap_serv_butone() and sendto_nocap_serv_butone() 
	- we still use IDs where its possible 
	- im tired now :P 

2001-01-28 08:59  davidt

	* modules/core/: m_kill.c, m_nick.c: 
	- Fix m_client.c / m_nick.c to mark clients introduced by a lazylink
	  as known by that lazylink (caused all kills of lazylink clients to
	  be replaced by nickcollision kills, which has the same effect
	anyway.. weird bug :) 
	- Fix broken logic in m_kill.c, which caused a core on attempting to
	  kill an unknown UID.  

2001-01-27 21:33  androsyn

	* include/client.h: Somebody commited an extra int aftype..This
	backs that change out...  

2001-01-27 21:07  androsyn

	vhosts...Now will somebody else test it :).  

2001-01-27 17:51  davidt

	- only reset idle on privmsg, not notice 

2001-01-27 14:35  fl_

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- dont reset idle time from notices.. only privmsg 
	  I didnt alter notice #channel.. altho I spose we should so its 
	  consistent..  

2001-01-27 13:02  davidt

	* modules/: m_lljoin.c, m_join.c, core/m_sjoin.c: Prevent local
	users creating fake vchans...  

2001-01-27 12:24  fl_

	* contrib/m_jupe.c: 
	- configfileentry -> servinfo 

2001-01-27 11:47  davidt

	* src/channel.c: Eventually found the weird bug which causes list.c
	to complain about users still being on channels when they are freed.  
	Remove channel from user as well as user from channel in
	delete_members.  

2001-01-27 09:44  davidt

	* src/send.c: We only actually need one buffer here...  

2001-01-27 08:18  davidt

	* modules/core/m_part.c: Remove warning, since it was being
	displayed when it shouldnt anyway...  

2001-01-27 08:12  davidt

2001-01-27 01:54  toot

	  wanted..  i this is right? . updated .depend 

2001-01-27 01:18  androsyn

	* src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_serv.c, include/s_conf.h: Fixed vhosts
	for outgoing connections finally.  

2001-01-27 00:05  lusky

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- fixed some more sol26 compile warnings 

2001-01-26 23:38  lusky

	* include/s_bsd.h, modules/core/m_nick.c, src/listener.c,
	src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c: 
	- removed lex/yacc output 
	- put socklen_t's back in 

2001-01-26 21:47  wcampbel

	* doc/: index.txt, operguide.txt: Minor docs cleanup Cleaned up the
	formatting of operguide.txt (wouldn't fit properly on an 80 
	character wide terminal) and added a couple missing :'s to the
	/quote lines 

2001-01-26 21:26  db

	* TODO:

	Update the TODO list Document the restricted auth {} option

	* modules/m_set.c: Cosmetical changes.  

2001-01-26 13:45  db

	* include/send.h, src/send.c: 
	- added kill_client() for formatting up a KILL to an uid or nick as

	IP address.  

2001-01-26 11:30  jdc

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_parser.y: TYES/TNO flipped to make
	default value for spoof_notice 'yes'.  This keeps us "compatible"
	with hybrid-6.  doc/example.conf changed to contain spoof_notice
	example.  

2001-01-26 11:02  androsyn

	* include/config.h: Somebody thought it was funny to commit
	config.h with #define IPV6 1 

2001-01-26 10:47  jdc

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_conf.c: 'spoof_notice' variable added to auth {} blocks. 
	Enables/disables notification for when a client's host is changed
	via 'spoof'.  

2001-01-26 10:10  androsyn

	* src/: irc_string.c, s_bsd.c: Fixes for identd checking for IPv6.  

2001-01-26 05:33  androsyn

	* src/ircd_parser.y: Fixed compile error for IPv4.  

2001-01-26 00:14  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- This fixes odd cores associated with accept code /quit and nick
	  changes...  ALL references to a client must be removed when it
	exits! 

2001-01-25 22:40  ejb

	* include/config.h, include/ircd_defs.h, src/irc_string.c,
	src/ircd.c: 
	- does this make IPv6 work? let's see.  

2001-01-25 20:11  wcampbel

	* TODO, doc/modeg.txt: Added the mode +g documentation.  Added
	another user suggestion to the TODO list 

2001-01-25 19:31  db

	* modules/: m_away.c, core/m_message.c: 
	- allow /away to take an /away off at any time, pace other /away 
	- do not reply to a notice with a notice!! in +g mode 

2001-01-25 14:27  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- cleaned up some logging that was just plain wrong 
	  and changed references to c/n's to "connect blocks" 

2001-01-25 14:00  fl_

	* BUGS, modules/m_stats.c: 
	- removed a fixed bug from bugs..  
	- till someone decides what the hell we're doing with stats p and
	  shide, we show users the reply..  I dont like the idea of noticing
	  all opers..  frankly, itd get annoying, and the MOTD usually gives
	  oper nicks/chans anyway, so..  

2001-01-25 12:40  fl_

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- opers shouldnt see IPs of servers connecting.. show them MASK_IP 
	  instead 

2001-01-25 12:24  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- replaced confusing host with name, its a server name not a DNS
	host name 

2001-01-25 12:03  androsyn

	* src/: irc_string.c, s_auth.c: Fixes for ident when compiled for
	IPv6 

2001-01-25 10:32  androsyn

	* src/: match.c, s_user.c: Fixed ircd from complaining about ':' in
	hostnames on connect.  I don't know if we want this to be on just
	for IPv6, but its on for IPv4 as well.  

2001-01-25 10:05  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- sendto_channel_remote_prefix() was using sendto_one when it 
	  should have been using send_message() this caused it to nicely
	  core on #%s%s%s... as sendto_one() is varargs unlike
	  send_message() This probably also explains some odd bugs cropping up
	with uids..  

2001-01-25 09:49  androsyn

	* src/s_auth.c: Fixed ident checking for IPv4.  Ident *may* work
	for IPv6 as well, but don't count on it

	  ConfItem->name is what should be used for server names 
	  fixing that caused a cascade of other bugs to show up.. neato 
	
	- first off, added numeric for RESTRICTED numeric.h, messages.tab 
	- added notification of restricted mode to s_user.c 
	- free and zero spasswd in free_conf() s_conf.c 
	- conf_add_server() should return an int, modifed s_conf.c s_conf.h 
	  if it fails, it should also log() and not free any given aconf, 
	  thats up to the caller 
	- fix ircd_parse.y to NOT ignore the result of conf_add_server 
	  and to free etc. whatever on errors 

2001-01-24 18:56  wcampbel

	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- partially added in "restricted=yes/no" in auth blocks 
	  this is the old little i line support. Needs code in channel.c in
	  set_mode() 
	- added code to use crypt() in server passwords depending on 
	  encrypted=yes/no flag in connect block 

2001-01-24 01:16  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- This code will need to be revisted for IPv6, but it at least works
	now.  

2001-01-24 00:49  db

	* modules/m_whowas.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- m_whowas.c was referencing ConfigFileEntry intead of ServerInfo 
	  causing a core. oops.  
	- cleaned up check_server() in s_serv.c, this is probably why 
	  irc.efnow.net had connect problems.  

2001-01-23 20:25  wcampbel

	* modules/core/m_server.c: Fixed spelling errors (Noticed by

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- removed the loop unrolling ... made it hard to read, also hid a
	  bug and loop unrolling is for the compiler to do.  
	- added no_hack_ops in serverinfo block, once set it will not 
	  allow anyone to hack ops from your server. no way, no how.  

2001-01-23 15:36  ejb

	* include/s_serv.h, src/s_auth.c:

2001-01-22 22:01  db

	* modules/m_info.c, modules/m_whois.c, src/channel.c: 
	- this fixes paul's /whois core. basically, network_name,
	  network_desc moved from ConfigFileEntry to ServerInfo. These two
	  modules weren't changed somehow to use the new structs. *oops* 

2001-01-22 21:48  wcampbel

	- initial commit of androsyn's ipv6 code, hacked up so it compiles.  
	  it accepts a connection, but doesn't get further than the initial 
	  connection, seems an fd is being weirded somewhere.  

2001-01-22 15:03  fl_

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- fixes opers@server and ident%host@server..

	  to be detected by autoconf and specified in the CFLAGS--XOPEN_SOURCE
	  *must* be defined before you parse any system includes.  
	- fixed a couple of pedantic compile warnings, there are still more.

	  efnet want support for it.  

2001-01-21 09:58  davidt

	* include/channel.h: updated depend, removed unused 'serverMask'
	from struct Channel (lazyLinksChannelExists is what everything

2001-01-21 08:06  toot

	* modules/core/m_kick.c: changed the default kick msg to the

2001-01-20 06:49  davidt

	* modules/core/m_part.c, src/vchannel.c: 
	- Tidy up m_part.c (merge vchan/nonvchan stuff into the same code,
	  so we aren't duplicating stuff everywhere) 
	- Make sure ##vchannel_1234 has a TS of 1234 when we create it with
	  CJOIN, fl- is doing the same for SJOIN i think :) 

2001-01-20 03:57  toot

	  add_listener() is now called directly from the parser.. no need to 
	  through gyrations. *BLOAT* 
	  This cleans up the parser a bit more as well.

2001-01-19 14:56  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	
	* Kill the POLLREADFLAGS/POLLWRITEFLAGS/POLLERRORS gunk. God I hated 
	  that 
	
	* replace it with something that makes a tad more sense- 
	  - check all the various flags on return from poll() to catch all
	    IO types. Yes, all the IO types will be defined in most useful
	    OSes even if it only pays attention to one of them 
	  - define POLLRDFLAGS as POLLIN and POLLWRFLAGS as POLLOUT for
	    older broken linux boxen 

2001-01-19 10:36  db

	* modules/core/m_kill.c:

	* src/s_bsd_select.c: 
	
	use the delay value when calling select(), rather than my hard-coded 
	value of '1'.  

2001-01-19 03:59  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_select.c: 
	
	&& != || :) 

2001-01-19 03:52  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_select.c: 
	
	Initial pass at the select code rewrite.  
	
	* it isn't multilist like the poll code. that would be kind of
	  stupid considering that the fd set size is a function of the maximum
	  open fd, rather than the number of fds in a "set".  
	
	* for some reason the compiler on my laptop is smoking heavy crack
	  with hybrid-7 now. It seems to work, but debugging shows a lot of
	  gremlins.  I'll try it on my -stable box now that I'm back online
	  and fix any last minute bugs.  

2001-01-19 00:39  ejb

	reasons.

2001-01-17 15:36  davidt

	* src/send.c: Fixed format bug found by bysin in ts_warn.  

2001-01-17 12:35  davidt

	* include/listener.h, src/listener.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	Fix /rehash of listen{}; blocks.  We still keep old listeners around
	until all clients 'using' them quit.  Currently s_user.c refers to
	localClient->listener, nothing else seems to need it.  

2001-01-17 12:28  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	- fixed a bug toyota found with +v not showing up in /names on anon
	chans 

2001-01-17 12:04  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- ping time out should use %d not %lu, cast it to int 

2001-01-17 10:23  ejb

	* src/: hook.c, ircd.c: 
	- fix problem with hooks, need init_hooks() *before*
	load_all_modules().  

2001-01-16 23:02  toot

	* src/s_misc.c: fixed timestamp in ircd.log 

2001-01-16 21:19  ejb

	* src/hook.c: 
	- another possible fix 

2001-01-16 21:02  ejb

	* include/hook.h: 
	- se ebelow 

2001-01-16 21:01  ejb

	* src/: hook.c, ircd.c: 
	- added hook_init, set hooks to zero at startup 

2001-01-16 09:56  wcampbel

	* tools/mkpasswd.c: Fixed a compiler warning on Solaris 

2001-01-16 08:57  ejb

	* contrib/spy_links_notice.c: 
	- commit links_notice.c 

2001-01-16 08:41  db

	* src/sprintf_irc.c: 
	- reverted sprintf_irc.c 
	  The entire point of sprintf_irc is to be much faster than sprintf 
	  not to be a complete replacement for it. Treat it as another
	  function entirely that has a similar name.  

2001-01-16 02:00  db

	* src/: client.c, s_bsd.c: 
	- fix to check_pings, this probably explains some of the odd
	  cores...  ptr->next is corrupt at times after an exit_client 
	- tidied up the comm_open() comm_accep() error handling 

2001-01-15 15:43  ejb

	* contrib/Makefile.in, include/hook.h, modules/m_links.c: 
	- added links_notice.so

	- removed an unneeded if() 

2001-01-15 14:20  fl_

	* modules/m_links.c: 
	- fixes to not show server IPs in /links to opers 

2001-01-15 10:05  db

	* include/client.h, src/client.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/tools.c: 
	- This fixes one of the nasty assert errors. comm_open() and
	  comm_accept() were both returning ENFILE instead of -1, which
	  happens to be 23.. This was seen as a valid fd. This was obviously
	quite wrong. (s_bsd.c) 
	
	- removed numerous debugging code in other files.  

2001-01-15 07:51  ejb

	* src/modules.c: 
	- slight cleanup to modrestart.  

2001-01-15 07:43  ejb

	* contrib/Makefile.in, contrib/spy_stats_notice.c,
	modules/m_stats.c: 
	- finished stats_notice.so 

2001-01-15 07:32  ejb

	* modules/m_accept.c: 
	- don't let people flood by accepting them more than once.  

2001-01-15 07:27  ejb

	* contrib/spy_stats_notice.c, include/hook.h, modules/m_stats.c: 
	- initial stats_notice.so, not finished yet.  

2001-01-15 07:20  wcampbel

	* tools/README.mkpasswd: And the docs too 

2001-01-15 07:17  wcampbel

	* tools/mkpasswd.c: Committed a bug fixed mkpasswd.c (also
	generates a more secure MD5 salt) 

2001-01-15 06:28  ejb

	* contrib/Makefile.in, contrib/spy_whois_notice.c, include/hook.h,
	modules/m_whois.c, src/Makefile.in, src/hook.c: 
	- added hook support for modules 
	  only has one hook so far, doing_whois, which is used for 
	  whois_notice.so (in contrib).  

2001-01-14 15:32  fl_

	* include/modules.h, src/ircd.c, src/modules.c: 
	- we now have a fully working, unobtrusive modrestart command 

2001-01-13 15:04  fl_

	* src/modules.c: 
	- added the beginnings of a modrestart command 
	  be warned: 
	  this command will atm generate about (roughly) 120 notices telling
	  you which have been unloaded and which have been reloaded, but im
	  tired and gunna finish it tomorrow 
	- because of that I didnt document it :), thatll come tomorrow

	blockalloced stuff.  

2001-01-11 18:22  ejb

	* include/md5.h, src/md5.c: 
	- possible fix for uint32_t problem 

2001-01-11 16:26  a1kmm

	* src/: s_misc.c, sprintf_irc.c: 
	- We now support %nu and %0nu (sort of, they are equivalent) in
	sprintf_irc.  

2001-01-11 15:34  davidt

	* src/client.c: report errors freeing localClient too 

2001-01-11 14:51  a1kmm

	* src/client.c: 
	- Fixed a bug where we frob and then use something.

	- Fixed some memory leaks and some potential buffer overflows and
	some compiletime warnings.  

2001-01-11 00:48  a1kmm

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y, s_conf.c: Cleaned up some of
	the memory leaks - nothing seems to leak from the parser or the
	lexer, but there still are leaks on rehash.  

2001-01-10 22:31  a1kmm

	* include/irc_string.h, include/ircd_defs.h, include/memory.h,
	include/modules.h, modules/m_dmem.c, modules/core/m_message.c,
	modules/m_whois.c, modules/m_whowas.c, src/Makefile.in,

	src/scache.c, src/send.c, src/sprintf_irc.c, src/tools.c,
	src/vchannel.c, src/whowas.c: Improved memory debugging so it
	actually works.  

2001-01-10 15:59  db

	* include/channel.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c: 
	- this removes the last remnant of bogus ban removal code..  
	  this should be done using another cleaner mechanism. blah.  
	- cleaned up mtrie_conf.c slightly 

2001-01-10 11:31  wcampbel

	NULL_POINTER_NOT_ZERO #defines 

2001-01-09 16:48  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- removed unneeded space in parse.c, do_numeric() this caused 
	  remote numerics to show up with an obvious extra space.  
	
	  due to this -> ircsprintf(t," :%s", parv[parc-1]); 

2001-01-09 13:23  wcampbel

	* modules/m_trace.c: We now show incomplete (unknown) connections
	in TRACE to opers

	- fixed backwards confusing if's on fd 
	- make sure CLIENT_EXITED is returned in s_user.c 

2001-01-09 07:47  wcampbel

	* modules/m_ping.c: Sending PING :<any text> should return 
	:<server> PONG <server> :<same text sent in> NOT :<server> PONG
	<server> :cptr->name 

2001-01-08 20:02  wcampbel

	* contrib/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Fixed
	the .depend's...We'll get a couple error messages when we run make
	depend now, but at least system libs (rsa.h) in /usr/local/lib on

	   was coring the ircd even worse 

2001-01-08 16:40  fl_

	* src/client.c: 
	- changed an -1 < to 0 > which should fix a core..  

2001-01-08 16:30  fl_

	* src/s_auth.c: 
	- commited dianes fix, modified slightly :) 

2001-01-08 14:26  wcampbel

	* tools/: Makefile.in, README, mkpasswd.c: Removed my md5mkpasswd
	and added in a replacement mkpasswd that can (if the system supports

	coming...use ./mkpasswd -h to see the usage 

2001-01-08 12:40  db

2001-01-08 08:36  db

	* include/s_auth.h, src/ircdauth.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	- dlinked s_auth.c 
	- in doing so found a nasty bug in s_bsd_poll.c where it would
	  "walk" over previous word to pollfds since a negative index was
	used... oops 
	- ircdauth.c will need some re-writes 

2001-01-08 08:24  madmax

	* include/client.h: added FLAGS_DRONE to OPER_UMODES for +e 

2001-01-08 07:58  toot

	modules from the config 

2001-01-07 20:16  toot

	* src/: s_conf.c, s_gline.c: expire_gline/tklines wasn't removing
	more than 1 entry at a time 

2001-01-07 19:55  db

	* include/s_auth.h, src/ircdauth.c: 
	- auth poll list did not need to be global...  
	  ircdauth.c references it atm, #if 0 for now... we'll have to
	  rethink how to do this.  
	- struct AuthRequest had a now unused index 

2001-01-07 18:34  db

	- i before e, except after c (spelling mistake in messages.tab) 

2001-01-07 17:57  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- this fixes an assert() failure if a client exits before DNS has
	  completed We forgot to delete_resolver_queries() in exit_client() in
	client.c 
	
	- I rewrote res.c to use dlink's instead of home grown link list
	code.  

2001-01-07 17:04  fl_

	* modules/core/m_kill.c: 
	- removed unused variable 

2001-01-07 16:03  db

	* modules/core/m_kill.c, src/client.c: 
	- client.c check_klines() was referencing bad ptr's due to the exit
	  client this is why it wasn't klining more than one client at a time.
	oops.  
	
	- fixed m_kill so user just see's a "Disconnected" message instead
	  of the inflammatory "killed by oper message" (as per suggestion of 
	  David Harmlein) *sigh* its sad we cannot have more oper
	  accountability to users, however, a significant proportion of
	  users are proving to be very nasty lusers....  

2001-01-07 08:53  fl_

	- initial start on INVARIANTS support.  

2001-01-06 21:27  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- removed quoting code from the k/d parser... the k/d lines in that 
	  file must never be generated by humans any more... and our /kline 
	  code ensures no bogus # in the middle of the file.  

2001-01-06 21:05  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- removed a major memory leak I introduced. *sigh* 
	  I had forgotten yylval.string is memory duplicated already in the
	  lexer.  
	- also removed a rule no longer used  (leaf_block) 

2001-01-06 20:34  davidt

	privmsg/notice for vchans Fixed some odd stuff in set_channel_mode
	that was wrong..  and i'm sure i probably broke something, since
	it's 3:30am.. *sigh* 

2001-01-06 20:18  wcampbel

	ConfigFileEntry struct, one no longer exists, the other is always

	bloat...  

2001-01-06 18:58  wcampbel

	* BUGS, INSTALL, contrib/README, doc/example.conf,

	hub_mask...  

2001-01-06 11:13  db

	* doc/example.conf, modules/core/m_server.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y:

	leafs about unknown people 

2001-01-06 10:46  davidt

	src/parse.c:

	missing blank line hardly matters 

2001-01-06 05:06  fl_

	* modules/m_users.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- we always need a local users reply, it breaks clients not to have
	  one, we just spoof it as the global reply 

2001-01-05 23:17  ejb

	* contrib/: Makefile.in, README, m_opme.c:

	- remove hash debugging code 

2001-01-05 19:18  ejb

	shide 

2001-01-05 18:44  ejb

	  +c connect monitor for watching for drones... rather than modify 
	  +c to give her the information she wants, I've added +e...  
	  Possibly only useful to pryzm *sigh* 

2001-01-05 13:37  toot

	a notice to remote chan members though 

2001-01-05 12:29  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- This finally fixes host server masks.. though the match loop in
	  here probably should move into s_conf.c 

2001-01-05 11:31  cosine

	src/s_conf.c:

	  actual name of the server on the net. switched them around in
	  HUB/LEAF code 

2001-01-05 08:27  toot

	* modules/m_knock.c, src/client.c, src/event.c, src/s_user.c: .
	changed some ugly %lu formating back to %d (caused compile warnings
	before) . use ircd.conf knock_delay instead of hard-coded 30
	seconds, for m_knock 

2001-01-05 07:52  toot

	* contrib/m_jupe.c, include/client.h, modules/m_connect.c,
	modules/m_whois.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c: . made +a umode
	  propagate and admins can -a/+a themselves too, again.  everything
	except /whois uses the conf flags as a check, rather than the umode.  
	. for local connects, always show idle time if shide is off, and
	  always show opers, and show your Own idle time.  

2001-01-05 07:51  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf, doc/modes.txt, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y: Document the usermode 'drone' '+e' and add
	support in oper_only_umodes for it.  

2001-01-05 05:40  toot

	* modules/m_users.c, src/s_user.c: don't show the local user count
	if it's just lies, cause of shide skip it instead 

2001-01-05 05:27  toot

	* src/s_user.c: it's okay to show the Total server count with shide
	on 

2001-01-05 05:17  toot

	* src/s_conf.c: updated s_conf.c CVS was playing tricks on me :) 

2001-01-05 04:57  toot

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, contrib/m_clearchan.c,
	include/s_conf.h, src/modules.c: . took out -pedantic compile flag 
	. put conf_add_hub_or_leaf() back in for now, cause ircd_parser.y
	needs it . use parse() to check param counts for m_client! :) .
	added /modreload, (modunload and modload in one)

2001-01-05 01:11  db

	* contrib/m_jupe.c, modules/core/m_server.c, src/client.c: 
	- fixed m_jupe.c so it will work without coring.  
	
	- fixed a possible nasty core in client.c, its possible a client 
	  will be on the unknown_list and be exited there, without being 
	  on a linklist... it will promptly core the server. oops.  
	  since it has no prev next pointers.  
	
	- patched m_hash.c so it will compile. its not very useful ATM 

2001-01-05 00:47  a1kmm

	 here?) 

2001-01-04 22:52  db

	- never commit until you have done a compile test. duh.  

2001-01-04 22:46  fl_

	* modules/: m_connect.c, core/m_squit.c: 
	- remote connects are giving wallops properly, this should fix it 

2001-01-04 22:43  db

	* include/client.h, src/channel.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- in the aop case, it was trying to send an UID for a server

	- started adding umode +e code to watch possible drones 

2001-01-04 22:22  fl_

	src/s_user.c: 
	- fixed too many arguments for format in m_gline.c

	   COMMENTS PLEASE 
	2. SHIDE off, non oper - Act as before For opers...act as before 

2001-01-04 07:49  adrian

	* src/parse.c: 
	
	We shouldn't just blindly return (0) if everything is ok.
	handle_message() might have been telling us something, and in any

2001-01-03 18:18  ejb

	* include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	- made modules.c use dlink 

2001-01-03 18:02  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: Remove prefix from NICK message during connect
	burst 

2001-01-03 17:31  adrian

	* include/tools.h, src/client.c, src/tools.c: 
	
	
	* add mem_frob(ptr, len) which will frob a block of RAM with
	  0xdeadbeef.  Nice for debugging 
	
	* frob cptr memory once we've finished with it. This should help us
	  trap bugs where we are referencing cptr/localptr RAM after its been
	  freed, which is evil bad and wrong.  

2001-01-03 17:30  adrian

	* src/packet.c: 
	
	Re-register IO interest if the client isn't CLIENT_EXITED, rather
	than if its CLIENT_OK. We can get a client parse error which doesn't
	mean we stop listening to the client.  

2001-01-03 17:30  ejb

	* include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	- better linked list handling in modules.c 

2001-01-03 16:46  davidt

	* RELNOTES, BUGS: Added some more info about problems with gettext.  

2001-01-03 16:21  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: Eeek, client_burst_if_needed should only check
	capabilities of local connections 

2001-01-03 16:09  davidt

	* modules/m_whois.c: Fix whois for LazyLinks 

2001-01-03 15:51  adrian

	* src/: s_bsd.c, s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	put the asserts back in. These catch real bugs in the code, and when 
	they get triggered they mean we need to fix something.  

2001-01-03 15:47  adrian

	* src/s_auth.c: 
	
	#preprocessor directives should start at col 0, not be indented.  

2001-01-03 15:21  davidt

	* modules/core/m_kill.c, modules/core/m_nick.c, modules/m_oper.c,
	modules/m_operwall.c, modules/core/m_squit.c, modules/m_wallops.c,
	src/ircdauth.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c, src/send.c: Yet another
	cleanup of lazylink stuff.  Attempt to introduce clients where
	appropriate, before sending things from them...  

2001-01-03 15:15  ejb

	* include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	- rewrote load_*_module to make it work.  

2001-01-03 13:54  fl_

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- fixes for whois: 
	- all "whois nick" replies look the same, same for "whois nick nick" 
	  regardless of where the target is 

2001-01-03 13:43  db

	* src/: ircd_parser.y, s_user.c: 
	- ok, added sanity tests in the parser to not try to DupString NULL
	  strings it won't work properly but at least it won't core.  
	- NICK should not send a prefix, to be consistent with previous
	versions 

2001-01-03 10:59  toot

	* src/channel.c: set the vchan_id in a much more simplistic way me
	so silly :P 

2001-01-03 10:59  madmax

	* README.FIRST, RELNOTES, INSTALL: made the comment about the old
	config not working more prominent too 

2001-01-03 10:57  madmax

	* README.FIRST, RELNOTES, INSTALL: I've tried to highlight the fact
	that you need to read INSTALL, and to ./configure --prefix as much
	as humanly possible.  From the number of people the changes have
	confused, i envision us being told by a lot of people 'it compiles
	okay but wont run!'..  

2001-01-03 08:34  madmax

	* README.FIRST, BUGS, RELNOTES, TODO: I was going to wait until we
	were ready to change the patch level.. but thought i'd commit these
	now before they got lost.  Just updated the files to reflect it
	being a beta release, and tidied stuff up a bit.  

2001-01-03 08:12  madmax

	* RELNOTES: Forgot to commit this (reference to BUGS file) 

2001-01-03 08:11  madmax

	* BUGS, README.FIRST: Added a list of known bugs for our beta
	release.. (and references to the file) 

2001-01-03 07:40  davidt

	* modules/m_join.c: 
	- Oops, fixed my last commit message in ChangeLog.  
	- Fixed m_join.c so it doesn't reveal who set the topic on +a
	channels.  

2001-01-03 07:35  davidt

	* modules/m_topic.c: m_join.c 

2001-01-02 22:56  db

	* include/client.h: 
	- yet another obsolete prototype gone 

2001-01-02 22:18  vx0

	* src/modules.c: 
	- modules.c:279 'char *err;' >-> 'const char *err;' 

2001-01-02 21:59  spookey

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	 - removes AUTOCONN output lines (ANNOYING) 

2001-01-02 21:39  db

	* configure, include/setup.h.in: 
	- updated configure setup.h.in 

2001-01-02 21:31  db

	* autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in, src/modules.c: 
	- committed cstone's contributed patch to fix modules under openbsd 

2001-01-02 20:04  db

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	- UNTESTED ignore fd < 0 instead of failing an assert *FOR NOW* 
	  adrian, might want to look at this one.  

2001-01-02 19:44  davidt

	* modules/m_names.c: minor patch to stop BitchX coring over an
	extraneous space in /names output 

2001-01-02 18:55  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: Fix kill on nickchange with lazylinks 

2001-01-02 18:27  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- backed out a changed until beta-2 , its broken hostmasking 

2001-01-02 17:41  davidt

	* src/s_user.c: Add (#if 0'd out) code not to introduce new NICK's
	to lazyleafs immediately.  This will also make debugging LazyLeafs
	easier, since it shows up the bugs elsewhere faster, without lots of
	squitting.  But after a beta.  

2001-01-02 17:35  db

	* include/channel.h: 
	- upped channel clean time for non vchans to 30 minutes 
	  I thought it was 30 before, it was only 15 

2001-01-02 15:57  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: I'm stupid, lcptr vs cptr...  

2001-01-02 15:40  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: *sigh*, fix sjoins _from_ lazylink leafs 

2001-01-02 15:24  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: Make SJOIN burst nicks where
	appropriate..  

2001-01-02 15:01  davidt

	* src/modules.c: Fix modunload core bug..  

2001-01-02 14:08  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: Another go at fixing netjoins on +a
	channels... *sigh* 

2001-01-02 13:10  wcampbel

	* doc/server-version-info, messages/custom.po: Updated some more
	docs 

2001-01-02 13:01  fl_

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- reapplied the fix that got removed *growl* 

2001-01-02 12:03  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c: 
	- Fix SJOIN halfop handling for lazylinks..  
	- Fix clear_ban_lists to prevent spewing random memory at clients 

2001-01-02 12:02  wcampbel

	* RELNOTES, TODO, doc/CIDR.txt,
	doc/technical/Persistent_Clients.txt, doc/example.conf,
	doc/index.txt: Updated a number of docs 

2001-01-02 11:51  fl_

	* include/send.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- fixes for davidt's patch 
	- use hide_or_not instead of ALL_CHANOPS in another case 

2001-01-02 11:08  davidt

	* src/send.c: Added back send_noncap_serv_butone 

2001-01-02 10:07  davidt

	* modules/core/m_message.c: Don't ignore server notices in +g mode 

2001-01-02 10:02  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: Send halfops as @ not % in SJOIN to a
	non-CAP_HOPS server 

2001-01-02 09:03  madmax

	* RELNOTES: Just some notes about it being an alpha release and
	suchlike.  

2001-01-02 09:02  madmax

	* include/patchlevel.h: Being pedantic - now reads
	'hybrid-7(alpha)' (hopefully not for long?) 

2001-01-02 09:01  madmax

	* Hybrid-team, README.FIRST: Tidied up a bit, pointed out its an
	alpha release.  

2001-01-02 08:23  davidt

	* modules/m_list.c: Fix /list #channame 

2001-01-02 03:06  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_server.c: Fixed up m_server a little to prevent
	the kiddies from killing recently established servers by dormant 
	unregistered connections.  

2001-01-02 01:28  a1kmm

	* src/channel.c: Added a little extra paranoia to fix_key_old 

2001-01-02 01:03  a1kmm

	* tools/convertconf.c: Fixed convertconf not to core when not all
	fields are present.  

2001-01-01 22:35  db

	* modules/m_userhost.c: 
	- ircsprintf() returns the length of the string it formats, 
	  I forgot. This means don't have to use an unnecessary strlen() 

2001-01-01 22:30  davidt

	* modules/m_cburst.c, modules/m_join.c, src/messages.tab,
	src/vchannel.c: 
	- Add back (fixed) logic to m_burst.c (otherwise LL cjoin breaks) 
	- Fix some more cases in m_join.c that reveal the vchan's true
	name..  
	- Fixed the comment in messages.tab for ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE 
	- Fix cjoin_channel to find a unique vchannel name, or return 
	  ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE 

2001-01-01 22:17  db

	* modules/m_cburst.c: 
	- removed some faulty logic in m_cburst.c, this cored us 
	  when the nick wasnt' present..  

2001-01-01 21:55  db

	* modules/m_userhost.c: 
	- our new parse.c splits everything up thats separated by a space 
	  unlike the old parse.c which stopped parsing into separate parv[] 
	  after maxargs? 
	- this will handle the RFC just fine, even epic works. Takes up to 
	  5 nicks as per the RFC 

2001-01-01 21:38  a1kmm

	* include/modules.h, modules/m_links.c: Fixed links so that when

	possible problems, Doh.

	* modules/m_lljoin.c: Fix possible core bug in lljoin...  

2001-01-01 21:17  davidt

	* modules/m_join.c: removed test for length of string (which is
	checked in build_channel_list) against address of pointer.. oops? 

2001-01-01 21:10  wcampbel

	* include/config.h: gline.log.<date> should be in LOGPATH, not
	ETCPATH 

2001-01-01 21:08  a1kmm

	* src/: ircd_parser.y, modules.c: Don't reload modules if they are
	already loaded and we see a module= in the config file.  

2001-01-01 21:06  davidt

	* modules/: m_challenge.c, m_join.c: Fix join 0 on vchans, and fix
	that stupid compiler warning for m_challenge.c 

2001-01-01 20:41  db

	* modules/m_join.c: 
	- parv[1] might be longer than max channel len if two channel names 
	  are catenated. better to check in build_channel_names 

2001-01-01 20:29  bysin

	* modules/m_join.c: Why didnt anyone make sure parv[1] was >
	CHANNELLEN, i had a fun time buffer overflowing that.  

2001-01-01 20:17  ejb

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- fix s_serv.c 

2001-01-01 20:09  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: Remove extra variable i forgot about 

2001-01-01 20:08  db

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- ignore bogus TS from servers. pure and simple. TS0 is broken 
	  It =will= desync for a while. *TOUGH* 

2001-01-01 19:57  ejb

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- DONT put all modules in example.conf, they are loaded on startup
	anyway.  

2001-01-01 19:54  davidt

	* src/vchannel.c: *Sigh*. sorry. I missed a space. :( 

2001-01-01 19:49  davidt

	* src/vchannel.c: Display <secret> for +s vchans in the vchan list.  

2001-01-01 19:10  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: better check realname too while we are at
	it...  

2001-01-01 19:07  a1kmm

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: Added a sanity test of user and hostname
	length from other servers.  

2001-01-01 18:57  wcampbel

	* modules/m_info.c: Added some more conf variables to INFO 

2001-01-01 18:33  davidt

	* src/channel.c: Fix a buffer overflow in send_mode_list 

2001-01-01 18:22  fl_

	* modules/m_join.c: 
	- sending "JOIN #channel" on its own would core the uplink: fixed 

2001-01-01 18:14  a1kmm

	* modules/m_whois.c: okay, now the cvs 'conflict' over m_whois.c
	should be completely resolved and madmax's comment out version 
	should stay...  

2001-01-01 18:09  a1kmm

	* doc/example.conf, modules/m_whois.c: Added module list to
	example.conf 

2001-01-01 17:52  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: Cleaned up the example.conf a little 

2001-01-01 17:44  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: Prevent non-human 'things' being sjoined
	to channels....  

2001-01-01 17:35  davidt

	* modules/m_join.c: Don't allow servers to JOIN channels, eugh 

2001-01-01 17:32  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: Eliminate race condition from s_serv.c, where we
	could add a server to serv_list (for SJOINS, etc) without first
	bursting it) 

2001-01-01 17:25  fl_

	* modules/m_users.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- dont show how many local users we have if shide is on 
	  instead make the local user reply the same as the global one 

2001-01-01 16:41  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- setting autoconnall to 0, should not affect the ability of others 
	  to connect to your server, or you to connect outgoing. If we want
	  the capability of disabling connections to the server, there
	  should be another set flags. Its a misnomer to double use
	autoconnall for that.  

2001-01-01 16:27  davidt

	* doc/example.conf, doc/whats-new.txt, include/s_conf.h,
	modules/m_cjoin.c, modules/m_info.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/modules.c: Add message_locale to
	doc/example.conf Add vchans_oper_only to doc/example.conf,
	doc/whats-new.txt and actually add the code to do it.  Fix modload,
	et all to send error messages if used by non ircops (instead of just
	silently ignoring the command) 

2001-01-01 16:15  madmax

	* modules/m_whois.c: The last patch broke /whois (You could only
	whois people on the same server if your uplink didnt forward the
	numerics - not something we want..) Just commented out A1kmm's code.  
	We can come back to this once we've cut a beta 

2001-01-01 15:57  toot

	* src/parse.c: 'already registered' should be a numeric, not a
	notice 

2001-01-01 15:28  davidt

	* modules/m_cjoin.c: Oops.  cjoin should also work on non-lazylinks
	now :) 

2001-01-01 15:07  db

	* modules/m_capab.c: 
	- ignore capab sent from remote server 

2001-01-01 14:52  davidt

	modules/m_join.c, modules/m_lljoin.c, src/channel.c, src/send.c,

	problems with vchan+LL.  
	- change cjoin on LL to ask the hub 
	- change cburst to support cjoin as well as join (minor change) 
	- change lljoin to support cjoin 
	- change lljoin to support joining vchans 
	- fix opsyncing to use the correct channame in vchans 
	- various other things I've forgotten 

2001-01-01 14:43  a1kmm

	* modules/m_whois.c: Fixed whois to always route.  Now show idle
	times even when SHIDE=1.  

2001-01-01 14:22  vx0

	* Hybrid-team: 
	
	Updated contributor names list 

2001-01-01 14:11  a1kmm

	* include/client.h, modules/m_away.c: 
	- Away is now better flood controlled.  

2001-01-01 14:08  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	- it should compile now..  

2001-01-01 14:01  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	- dont sent people a +e/+I list when they get opped in a +a chan

	* Hybrid-team: Added me cause I'm lame.  

2001-01-01 13:49  db

	* include/s_serv.h, src/ircd.c: 
	- delay initial startup of try_connections() to forestall nick
	  collides because of servers that haven't noticed the server restart.  

2001-01-01 13:45  bysin

	* modules/m_userhost.c: Oops, fixed buffer overflow again.  

2001-01-01 13:39  bysin

	* modules/m_userhost.c: I fixed a buffer overflow in this.  Right
	before its gunna be released.  I hope this works.

	- just stuck an early draft of this into cvs 

2000-12-31 22:09  wcampbel

	* modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: make depend needs to have
	the CFLAGS in addition to -MM.  This is for making sure that the
	error messages associated with gcc not being able to find
	/usr/local/include/libintl.h don't crop up.

	between servers? argh. see bug #15 

2000-12-31 18:53  davidt

	* modules/core/m_part.c: parting a vchan should send vchan->chname

	* modules/core/m_message.c, src/send.c: Fixes to allow @#chan and
	+#chan to work correctly.  

2000-12-31 15:53  db

	* include/s_serv.h, src/channel.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- really ANONOPS is way longer than any other capability we have 
	  lets shorten it to AOPS ok? 

2000-12-31 15:39  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- optimized can_join a bit 
	  No need to generate an expensive to generate string twice, so
	  added check_banned as a helper function for is_banned that way can
	  share the strings from can_join 
	- make_nick_user_host was being called, then strcpy'ed. dumb. why
	  not tell it where to generate the string in the first place? and
	  remove a dumb strcpy? 

2000-12-31 14:53  spookey

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	 - fixes flood control... >= not > 

2000-12-31 13:07  db

2000-12-31 09:40  lusky

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- david (accidentally?) moved the %type's back to the top, they've
	  got to be below the %tokens.  

2000-12-31 09:10  toot

	* modules/m_cjoin.c, modules/m_connect.c, modules/m_invite.c,
	modules/m_join.c, modules/m_kline.c, modules/core/m_kick.c,
	modules/core/m_kill.c, modules/m_locops.c, modules/m_oper.c,

	modules/core/m_part.c, modules/core/m_squit.c, modules/m_unkline.c,
	modules/m_user.c, modules/m_wallops.c, src/parse.c: . changed most
	remaining param counts so that parse() checks them . servers don't
	  send USER any more do they? - removed some checks which were only
	used for that anyway..  . removed a few more redundant checks, which
	parse() takes care of . show "*" inplace of Nick for unregged users
	with no nick 

2000-12-31 07:47  spookey

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure, src/Makefile.in: 
	 - minor cleaups 

2000-12-31 07:39  davidt

	with channel modes.. although there are still a few bugs left :/ 

2000-12-31 02:06  toot

	* modules/m_list.c, src/channel.c, src/vchannel.c: . fixed a
	possible overflow in m_list with persistant vchans . moved the
	  vchan_id setting into remove_user_from_chan so the user is still in
	a dlist_list :P 

2000-12-31 01:37  db

	* include/config.h.dist, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- hard to find typo in ircd_parser.y yyval instead of yylval 
	  caused it to core parsing message_local="string"; 

2000-12-31 00:44  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c: 
	- this is some very old fugly hacked code we had in hybrid-6 to 
	  allow multiple Q lined nicks ... never mind it was a hack, its 
	  gone.  
	
	- also moved the %type block back in ircd_parser.y until debugged 
	  the set locale code.  

2000-12-30 23:03  db

	parms good.  

2000-12-30 18:27  fl_

	- more solaris fixes, should now build and install cleanly 

2000-12-30 16:22  db

2000-12-30 16:10  db

	* include/ircd_defs.h, src/parse.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c:

2000-12-30 15:25  davidt

	* include/s_serv.h, src/channel.c, src/s_serv.c, src/send.c: 
	- Create a new capability: CAP_ANONOPS for servers that support +a 
	- Fix +a so it's only sent to servers supporting it 
	- Fix +a so that nonops still see modes they should, but as server
	modes.  
	- Fix sendto_channel_local to send NONOPS messages to voiced users
	too.  

2000-12-30 14:46  lusky

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/setup.h.in, src/irc_string.c, src/linebuf.c: 
	- check for strings.h for bzero() on solaris 

2000-12-30 13:22  lusky

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in, tools/Makefile.in: 
	- have autoconf detect whether -export-dynamic is needed for ld 

2000-12-30 12:54  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- I hate broken tree's resolved a conflict.. weird conflict too 
	  looked identical the two sections 

2000-12-30 12:47  lusky

	* src/: ircd_parser.y, parse.c: 
	- solaris yacc is picky picky picky 
	- replace strsep() with strtoken() 

2000-12-30 12:44  lusky

	* modules/m_set.c: 
	- oops, forgot an arg to sprintf 

2000-12-30 11:28  lusky

	* modules/m_set.c: 
	- missed another setenv() 

2000-12-30 11:19  lusky

	* src/: ircd.c, ircd_parser.y: 
	- eradicated setenv(), it's not portable.  specifically sol2.6
	  doesn't have it.  

2000-12-30 08:12  fl_

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- Fix for IP klines 
	- We now check to see if remote klines exist locally, before
	applying them 

2000-12-30 07:42  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- removed ';' that were in the wrong spot, these caused bison and
	  solaris yacc to have a fit.  

2000-12-30 07:14  db

	* src/vchannel.c: 
	- chptr->vchan_id will never be a NULL pointer so the test wasn't
	  doing anything at all. Its declared as 
	  char            vchan_id[NICKLEN*2];   /* use this for empty
	  vchans */ not a char *; One could do if[chptr->vchan_id[0]) but
	  then once set vchan_id[0] would never be null either.  

2000-12-30 05:34  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: added a paranoid check in pick_vchan_id 

2000-12-30 02:52  lusky

	* src/: fileio.c, linebuf.c, send.c: 
	- use errno.h instead of sys/errno.h.  freebsd and redhat don't
	  care, but solaris does.  

2000-12-30 02:32  toot

	* src/channel.c: moved the code that set vchan_id up 

2000-12-30 02:28  lusky

	* src/: ircdauth.c, s_auth.c, s_bsd.c: 
	- more compile warning fixes.  mmmm, socklen_t.  compiles on
	  redhat6.1 now without warnings (if you fix the broken
	  /usr/include/bits/socket.h by hand).  

2000-12-30 01:17  lusky

	started cleanup of compiler warnings 

2000-12-29 20:53  lusky

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- hack to make the developer CFLAGS the default.  You can still set
	  CFLAGS in your environment before running configure if you want to
	override them.  

2000-12-29 20:40  lusky

	* TODO: added my IM pipedream to TODO 

2000-12-29 19:28  davidt

	ircd-hybrid-6...  

2000-12-29 19:20  davidt

	* TODO, modules/core/m_message.c, src/send.c: Fix $$/$# -- still
	problems with LL, just like everything else..  I'll look into that
	[again] later..  

2000-12-29 19:07  lusky

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- don't recurse into messages if we don't have gettext 

2000-12-29 19:01  wcampbel

	* INSTALL: Document problem with old openssl installed in
	/usr/local/lib failing to link the RSA stuff used in Hybrid 

2000-12-29 18:52  davidt

	* messages/Makefile.in: Ignore errors installing message files..
	hrm.. maybe leaving the .mo in the repo wasn't such a bad idea..
	*sigh* 

2000-12-29 18:12  lusky

	* TODO: updated TODO 

2000-12-29 17:52  lusky

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/configure.in, include/config.h,
	include/config.h.dist, include/m_info.h, include/setup.h.in,
	messages/Makefile.in: 
	- added rm config.cache to make autoconf 
	- fixed configure to find gettext() in /usr/local/lib/libintl.a 
	- kludge in config.h so HAVE_GETTEXT follows HAVE_LIBINTL 
	- custom.mo shouldn't be in the respository 
	- removed HAVE_GETTEXT from m_info, USE_GETTEXT is what we care
	about 

2000-12-29 17:21  davidt

	* modules/: m_kline.c, core/m_mode.c: Stop LL leafs replying to
	MODEs from servers with another MODE..  this should never happen,
	but it is currently (see bug #7 on hybzilla).  

2000-12-29 16:59  fl_

	* include/send.h, src/channel.c, src/send.c: 
	- removed the sendto_match_noncap_servs(), as its now redundant 
	- if a user sets mode +h nick, and hes on a server that doesnt
	  support halfops, he would be opped.  we still pass the +h as far as
	  possible, but do nothing to that user 

2000-12-29 16:23  wcampbel

	* messages/custom.po, src/messages.tab: "Permission Denied-" ->
	"Permission Denied -" This has been driving me crazy 

2000-12-29 16:19  wcampbel

2000-12-29 13:01  fl_

	* TODO, doc/technical/send.txt, include/send.h, src/channel.c,
	src/send.c: 
	
	- Added sendto_match_noncap_servs to send.c, and documented it 
	- Send mode #channel +h nick as +h via sendto_match_cap_servs, and
	  as +o via sendto_match_noncap_servs, thus keeping the channel synced 
	- Updated my todo 

2000-12-29 13:00  db

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: 
	- fixed bug in m_sjoin.c that cored server. Non local servers being 
	  introduced via sjoin and given by sptr, do not have a LocalUser
	  part hence, this field is NULL and will core if you try to
	  refernce the caps field using IS_CAP() 

2000-12-29 10:39  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	
	- fixed a bug I made which caused a -o nick when they werent being
	deopped 

2000-12-29 10:23  fl_

	* TODO: 
	
	- gave myself a todo list..  

2000-12-29 09:43  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	
	- +e/+I modes can now only be seen by chanops 

2000-12-29 09:33  davidt

	* autoconf/configure.in, configure, src/Makefile.in,
	tools/Makefile.in: Fix gettext() for FreeBSD
	(LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure).  Anyone with autoconf
	knowledge know how to make it check /usr/local/lib automagically? 

2000-12-29 07:08  madmax

	* modules/: core/m_server.c, m_links.c: Links are now stored in the
	file in a format resembling normal links output ie "servername
	uplink(me.name) :hops(1) info" This makes it look a bit prettier in
	mirc etc ;) Also it now outputs me.name in the links list (again for
	consistency).  

2000-12-29 03:34  toot

	* src/channel.c: flame's right.. there's no need to send +e/+I when
	you get opped in a +a chan.  

2000-12-29 02:54  toot

	* modules/m_version.c, src/channel.c: . hide H in version with
	hide_server . use MAXMODEPARAMS rather than 4 in the +a sync stuff 

2000-12-29 01:36  db

	* include/motd.h, modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- increased MessageFileLine length this should be malloced ;-/ 
	- added server info to user seen /links 

2000-12-28 23:57  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- fixed another bug in s_conf.c 
	  recheck_class() had the bad side effect of moving opers from oper 
	  class to their old class on a /rehash... It also had the side
	  effect of dropping already made connections.. not cool Its not
	  necessary to recheck classes as it happens... fixed.  

2000-12-28 22:46  db

	* include/config.h, include/ircd.h, include/motd.h,
	include/s_conf.h, modules/m_links.c, modules/core/m_server.c,
	src/ircd.c, src/motd.c: 
	- ok. this is the first cut at building an user readable /links 
	  from doing our own /links and storing in a file for off line use.  

2000-12-28 21:38  fl_

	* src/channel.c: 
	
	1. Added error message if user is unopped, and does a /mode #chan +e 
	2. +b/+d modes are no longer shown to be removed/placed when a user
	   is deopped/opped in a +a channel, they can see the lists anyway so
	   they dont need us to keep them in sync..  
	3. If you -h'd someone on a +a channel, they didnt see the -h: fixed 
	4. If the channel is +a, /mode #chan +d wont tell you who set the
	   ban if youre unopped, same as +b 
	
	I wanted to remove the +e/+I mode from the sync too.. need to wait
	to talk to david first tho. :) 

2000-12-28 21:19  wcampbel

	When a channel goes +a, tell everyone that the channel has been
	massdeoped When it goes -a, tell everyone that the ops have been
	mass oped..  When an individual user is opped/deoped, tell only
	them.  

2000-12-28 16:29  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	
	- fixed mode bug (thank you, Diane) 
	- I hear that a new messages/custom.mo wouldn't hurt :)

	* doc/technical/whats-new-code.txt: 
	
	Add my stuff to the code whats-new file. Can everyone add their own? 

2000-12-28 14:43  adrian

	* README.FIRST, doc/index.txt: 
	
	add a documentation index.txt file in doc/ so we can at least
	attempt to show people what we have avaliable. Perhaps it should be
	called README, I dunno.  

2000-12-28 14:35  adrian

	there.. with room for more ;) 

2000-12-28 12:09  davidt

	* doc/example.conf: Add nick_changes=yes; to example.conf 

2000-12-28 11:00  davidt

	NON-opers 

2000-12-28 10:47  bill

	* modules/: m_join.c, m_lljoin.c, core/m_sjoin.c: 
	
	- added hyb6 compatibility checks for halfops (best solution is to
	tell remote s  ervers that they're regular ops) 
	- updated dependancy file accordingly 

2000-12-28 10:28  davidt

	* modules/m_set.c, src/s_serv.c: It would also core sending the
	failure message.. bleh.  

2000-12-28 10:17  davidt

	* src/s_serv.c: /set autoconn with no params would core the server.  

2000-12-28 10:03  bill

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	
	- fixed typo 

2000-12-28 09:52  toot

	with most irc clients 

2000-12-28 09:17  toot

	* modules/m_whois.c: . check /set, rather than ircd.conf option for
	hide_server in m_whois 

2000-12-28 08:00  db

	* modules/m_topic.c: 
	- oops. I broke remote topic 

2000-12-27 23:55  lusky

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/setup.h.in, src/modules.c: removed a bunch of unneeded junk
	from configure script fix for missing RTLD_NOW on openbsd 

2000-12-27 22:42  lusky

	* Hybrid-team, src/version.c.SH: fixed some typos in ChangeLog
	   (yes, you can edit ChangeLog even though it's automatically
	updated).  Major cleanup to Hybrid-team version.c.SH now reads
	../Hybrid-team removed configure from Makefile.in and added new make
	autoconf option 

2000-12-27 22:18  lusky

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/acconfig.h,
	autoconf/configure.in, include/s_bsd.h, include/setup.h.in: fixed
	scoklen_t check 

2000-12-27 21:54  wcampbel

	* INSTALL, include/m_info.h: 
	1. Document some of the configure options (kqueue!!!) 
	2. Bring INFO up to date (show if OPENSSL is enabled or not,
	   STATS_NOTICE no longer compiled in, so don't show it) 

2000-12-27 21:13  wcampbel

	* Hybrid-team, TODO, src/version.c.SH: 
	1. Updated my part of the TODO list 
	2. Synchronized Hybrid-team and version.c.SH (einride in one, flame
	   in the other, and Wohali's email address changed) 

2000-12-27 19:27  ejb

	* Makefile.in, TODO, modules/m_restart.c: 
	- make ocnifugre should run conifgure as well as building it 
	- make /restart require server name 

2000-12-27 19:15  davidt

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c: Oops, do not use sendto_ll_.. for sjoin 

2000-12-27 18:51  davidt

	* contrib/README: 
	- add readme for cintrib 

2000-12-27 17:56  davidt

	* src/: client.c, parse.c: Fix rather confusing message to opers
	when a server sends a numeric directed at a server.  Fix
	exit_one_client so that we take LLs into account when a client
	quits.  

2000-12-27 17:40  davidt

	* modules/: m_gline.c, m_ping.c: Fix ping to prevent servers
	throwing 402 nosuchserver numerics at each other

2000-12-27 16:52  ejb

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- check for socklen_t 

2000-12-27 16:45  ejb

	* Makefile.in: 
	- readd include/ to Makefile 
	- make configure be rebuilt automatically when needed.  

2000-12-27 16:41  wcampbel

	* doc/operguide.txt: Added Reidel's operguide.txt (Currently for
	Hyb5/6, in progress for Hyb7) 

2000-12-27 16:40  ejb

	* include/Makefile.in: 
	- oops, forgot to add this.  

2000-12-27 16:40  db

	* src/restart.c: 
	- fixed the cold restart for now, really should have a warm restart
	as well 

2000-12-27 15:24  db

	* Makefile.in: 
	- removed include from Makefile.in for now 

2000-12-27 14:37  ejb

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	- install headers into ircd/include

	later) 

2000-12-27 14:19  davidt

	* modules/core/m_message.c: Allow remote servers to send notices 

2000-12-27 13:30  davidt

	modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c,
	src/send.c: Massive bunch of fixes for LazyLinks.  INVITE now works
	if a hub is trying to relay an INVITE to a LL leaf which doesn't
	know about the channel yet.  TOPIC now works if a user on a LL leaf
	tries to get the topic for a channel the leaf doesn't know about 
	Hubs now only send MODE changes to LL leafs that know about the user 
	coredump in LLJOIN fixed..  some other misc stuff too...  

2000-12-27 10:15  db

	* modules/m_unkline.c: 
	- wrong parmcount, cores each of unkline, undline, ungline 

2000-12-27 10:05  db

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- use the parameter block, don't core on 0 parameters for dline 

2000-12-27 09:50  davidt

	* src/modules.c: Fixed the off-by-one error in the paramcount 

2000-12-27 09:49  davidt

	* modules/m_set.c: Added back /quote set msglocale, which vanished
	mysteriously when the new table-based SET code was comitted.  
	Reworked the argument handling for the SET handlers in the process, 
	handlers can now take: char; char, int; or int; arguments.  

2000-12-27 09:15  db

	* include/client.h, src/s_user.c: 
	- must use ClearOper() macro to deoper, otherwise handler is still
	  set to oper handler. ooops 

2000-12-27 08:26  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: Removed references to the old conf format
	removed 

2000-12-27 06:24  davidt

	* Makefile.in, messages/Makefile.in, messages/custom.po: Fix up
	messages/ to work with the new install stuff 

2000-12-27 05:14  db

	* modules/core/m_kick.c: 
	- notify target if source is a half-op and target is an op 

2000-12-27 04:43  db

	* modules/m_topic.c: 
	- topic change from server should appear to come from local server 
	  always.  

2000-12-27 04:05  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- pathological case would cause a core. If someone fed back the 
	  same server as the server as "me" it would core since there would
	  be no ->from... This bug looks like it would be in hybrid-5,
	  hybrid-6 and all 2.8 derivitatives 

2000-12-26 21:20  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: Document MD5 oper password support 

2000-12-26 19:31  db

	* src/: ircd_parser.y, s_conf.c: 
	- if test on name not className caused spoofs to lose their classes 

2000-12-26 19:08  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- missing DupString() on cconf classname 

2000-12-26 18:28  bill

	* doc/example.conf, modules/m_topic.c: 
	
	- fixed typos 

2000-12-26 16:54  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- fixed bug in m_nick, leafs always should send their nick changes 
	  since a leaf always introduces all of its clients to their uplink 
	  but hubs should continue to watch they do not send nick changes
	  for clients that have not been introduced yet to leafs.  

2000-12-26 15:18  db

	* modules/: m_accept.c, m_knock.c, m_topic.c, m_who.c,
	core/m_mode.c: 
	- number of wrong counts in the parmcount table.. caused these to
	  core parc inludes the source as well as arguments 

2000-12-26 12:17  db

	* modules/m_lljoin.c, modules/m_topic.c, src/modules.c,
	src/parse.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- lljoin was checking for arg count, when thats no longer necessary 
	  given the new parser 
	
	- parser got the parc count off by one when checking for vality, off
	  by one error.. also cleaned up formatting 
	
	- modules.c two functions were referring to basename() which had
	  been changed to irc_basename() 
	
	- s_serv.c was sending topic to servers that didn't see that server
	  on channel, changed interface so s_serv.c bursts topic info to
	  lazyleaf as well as setting topic 
	
	- changed m_topic.c to allow servers to set topic and topic info 

2000-12-26 08:55  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- don't burst the TOPIC in s_serv.c until there is a ms_topic()
	  handler the server isn't on channel so the leaf will send back an
	  not on channel numeric to the server! 
	
	- cleaned up setting of fd_note in m_nick()... in both cases it 
	  is known the nick is local, as non local nicks are handled in
	  separate function.  

2000-12-26 08:07  db

	* modules/m_list.c: 
	- fix core in m_list.c if /list of non-existent channel is done.
	oops 

2000-12-25 22:14  spookey

	* src/modules.c: 
	 - moved basename() to irc_basename() -- compatability issue with
	 old glibc systems (string.h used to declare basename()) 

2000-12-25 15:05  ejb

	* modules/m_knock.c: 
	- fix knock paramcount 
	- make knock use +p to stop it, not +s 

2000-12-25 14:40  wcampbel

	* doc/: example.conf, modes.txt: 
	1. Noted that auth blocks with redirection MUST have a class 
	2. is- says anonops is hideops 

2000-12-25 12:50  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- I'm not sure how this ever worked before..  
	  yylval.string should be DupString'ed in MOST cases before adding
	  to conf link list 
	
	  UNTESTED folks, sorry have to do the Christmas day family visiting
	  thing NOW 

2000-12-25 12:02  ejb

	* modules/m_whois.c: 
	- allow remote whois.  

2000-12-25 11:52  toot

	* modules/: m_time.c, m_who.c: replaced some
	ConfigFileEntry.hide_server with GlobalSetOptions.hide_server 

2000-12-25 11:32  ejb

	* messages/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, src/parse.c,
	tools/Makefile.in: 
	- split out some of parse() into a couple of new functions, 
	  handle_command() and string_to_array().  

2000-12-25 11:22  toot

	* modules/m_stats.c, src/s_gline.c: . don't want it to say its
	listing pending_glines if there aren't any . param counts should al
	be correct now 

2000-12-25 10:59  toot

	* include/s_gline.h, modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_kline.c,
	modules/m_stats.c, modules/m_who.c, modules/m_whois.c,
	modules/m_whowas.c: . fixed soem paramcounts in modules . make
	GLINE_CLEANUP_TIME a bit more frequent 

2000-12-25 10:27  wcampbel

	1. Updated my TODO list 
	2. Updated whats-new.txt a little 
	3. Put a missing space in flame's name 
	4. Added a summary of the user and channel modes 

2000-12-25 09:09  db

	* modules/m_motd.c: 
	- I'm convinced. Lets allow remote motd in non shide mode at least 
	  Its a module, so it can all be changed on the fly anyway.  

2000-12-25 09:04  db

	* modules/m_lljoin.c: 
	- sending channel_member_names() to a server is not useful, sending
	  it to the client that just joined, might be.  

2000-12-25 08:59  toot

	* include/s_gline.h, modules/m_gline.c, modules/core/m_nick.c,
	src/s_gline.c: . made glines and pending_glines into dlink_lists .
	couple of minor cleanups/cosmetic changes to m_nick 

2000-12-25 00:03  db

	* include/handlers.h, modules/m_motd.c: 
	- motd of non local servers should not be shown to users 

2000-12-24 23:32  db

	* modules/m_whois.c, src/parse.c: 
	- was missing nick in do_numeric in parse.c ... 401 was not 
	  (no such nick) was not being seen properly by client on LL server.  

2000-12-24 22:54  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- ummmm parse isnt' handed a null terminated line, its handed the
	  end of of the buffer as well as the start. The end of the buffer if
	  its rfc compliant, will be '\r' '\n' but no terminating '\0' 
	  so, take bufend look one back that should be a '\n', then blast it 
	  then look to see if there is a '\r' before it, if so blast it as
	  well then thats it... end is now the valid end of the buffer 

2000-12-24 22:06  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c, src/parse.c: 
	- numeric sent to server should be announced what it is ...  
	- nick change while not on channel would not be propogated to a LL
	  server causing those mysterious nick collides. oops.  

2000-12-24 21:39  db

	* modules/m_rehash.c: 
	- extra '\n' in log() not needed 

2000-12-24 21:31  wcampbel

	* doc/: example.conf, simple.conf: 
	1. Forgot to change the formatting in oper_only_umodes 
	2. Add 'rej' '+r' to oper_only_umodes 
	3. Created a new simple.conf 
	
	--snip-- # NOTE TO DEVELOPERS:  Do we set defaults for the variables
	in the general #                      block?  If so, then I can
	leave out most of the things #                      in here and make
	it simpler to configure.  If not, #                      please let
	me know so I can document things clearly --end-- 

2000-12-24 21:05  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- bufend was already there, so use it...  

2000-12-24 20:18  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: Add a little more documentation to is-'s
	oper_only_umodes 

2000-12-24 18:29  db

	I hate my own grammar.  

2000-12-24 16:27  toot

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_unkline.c, src/s_conf.c: SOD IT!! 
	made tklines into a dlink_list 

2000-12-24 16:02  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Explain what we're not doing with the poll fd lists ..  Yes, I'll
	get there after some more feedback.. :-) 

2000-12-24 15:58  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_select.c: 
	
	Stick in an #error in the code - I still haven't finished the poll()
	code, so I haven't rewritten the select code ..  

2000-12-24 15:45  db

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- removed lame test that was restarting irc.mcs.net for no reason..  
	  under heavy ddos the server was being lagged enough to restart..  
	  No real need for this test.  

2000-12-24 15:44  db

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- remove last remnant of evil #ifdef CHROOT 

2000-12-24 15:40  adrian

	* src/ircd.c: 
	
	Change some of the comments which aren't applicable now that the
	old-school io loop is gone.  

2000-12-24 15:39  adrian

	* include/s_serv.h, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	
	
	* move try_connections() into an event, where it should have been a
	  long time ago. Its called every TRY_CONNECTIONS_TIME seconds, which
	  right now is defined as 60 seconds 
	
	* Make most of ioloop() redundant. MMmmmm.. ioloop() looks sexy-slim
	now..  

2000-12-24 13:27  toot

	* include/supported.h, src/s_conf.c: . tkline expiry kept
	crashing.. redid it so it won't . added VCHANS to 005 numeric 

2000-12-24 11:43  db

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, modules/core/m_mode.c,
	src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/parse.c: 
	- tidied up isomer's parse.c mods... Then noted that someone was 
	  sending a numeric to "me" which led to...  
	- fixing who sends the MODE message in m_mode, it should be
	  sptr->name not me.name 
	- Then noted a conflict in LOGPATH, which I resolved by changing 
	  LOGPATH in ircd_parser.y ircd_lexer.l to T_LOGPATH 
	- removed with extreme prejudice all UID/GID CHROOT crap. my
	  goodness efnet servers are dedicated now, and if you really insist,
	  set up a jail or something.  

2000-12-24 08:59  wcampbel

	* INSTALL, doc/example.conf: Revised a couple documents 

2000-12-24 07:49  adrian

	* include/config.h: 
	
	Create a LOGPATH which contains the logfile directory, and then 
	stick ircd.log in there instead of ETCPATH.  
	
	What *really* should happen is that these paths and filenames should 
	be defined in the configuration file, but... :-) 

2000-12-24 00:19  isomer

	* src/parse.c: 
	* rewrote do_numeric(), it nolonger accepts multiple targets (can't
	happen) and hopefully has bugs removed. on the other hand tho, it's
	only been tested in that it compiles...  

2000-12-23 22:29  ejb

	* include/handlers.h, modules/m_accept.c, modules/m_version.c,
	src/modules.c: 
	- fixed bug whereby a module was not actually dlclose()d in
	  unload_one_module, hence trying to reload a module would actually
	reload the old one 
	- fixed paramcount in accept 
	- added mo_version to version_msgtab 

2000-12-23 22:20  isomer

	* modules/m_version.c: Changed the way mo_version works with

	  is it likely to be ? 

2000-12-23 13:57  ejb

	* modules/m_ison.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/parse.c:

	  rewrite, which meant no MODE's were being sent... I "fixed" it
	  previously in the wrong way, which resulted in weird five mode ops
	etc.

	* include/s_conf.h, src/s_conf.c: 
	- Ok, ALL the old support for old style confs is gone now, except
	  for K/D lines That means IF YOU HAVEN'T CONVERTED FORMAT YET, DO IT
	  NOW, OR IT WILL NOT RUN. capiche? 
	  I'll be able to simplify the parser in a bit a little more.  

2000-12-22 15:59  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- ok. attach_cn_lines() was just plain wrong.  
	  The code was matching on hostname(ip) instead of servername 
	  One needs to look up by servername, then check if the hostname/ip
	  matches..  This explains why I had problem with multi servers on
	  same host but different names.  
	
	  I think I got this right... but I am NOT sure if it works for
	  hostmasked servers properly. that has to be verified asap. Might
	  need a match() in the code..  

2000-12-22 14:04  wcampbel

	* modules/m_oper.c, tools/Makefile.in, tools/README: 
	1. Cleaned up a comment and trailing blank lines from m_oper.c

	XXX UNTESTED UNTESTED UNTESTED UNTESTED 
	
	(Go a broken CVS tree. :-) 
	
	* change HANDLED_OK to CLIENT_OK. God knows why the two return
	  values from parse_client_queued() (at least from ircd_defs.h) turned
	  out to be CLIENT_EXITED or HANDLED_OK. Lets hear three cheers for
	great coding! 
	
	* Changed parsed_client_queued() to return CLIENT_OK if everythign
	  went well (it was returning a numerical value..) 
	
	* Actually listen to the return values of parse_client_queued() in 
	  determining whether to schedule antoher comm_setselect() or 
	  reregister the client in the flush list.  
	
	A bug was found where a fd was being thrown onto the flush list in 
	flood_recalc() which would then trigger an assertion. This won't
	call comm_setflush() if the client has just exited.  
	
	What *should* happen in comm_checktimeouts() is there should be an 
	assertion that the fd is open (flags.open) before calling the
	handler..  just to be anal.

	- the modes not propagating on sjoin was my fault.  
	  channel_modes() set the +ntz in modebuf, which I then promptly 
	  walked over... one has to leave those modes in then add the +o and
	  +v

2000-12-20 18:11  wcampbel

	* doc/example.conf: example.conf is now correct for the current

	on the options 

2000-12-20 17:59  db

	* modules/m_gline.c, src/ircd_parser.y:

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_kline.c, modules/core/m_nick.c,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- shared {} can now have user/host for user@host of oper allowed 
	  to place a remote kline from server given by name.

2000-12-20 11:35  db

2000-12-20 11:29  db

	* modules/m_topic.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- TOPIC_UH is =gone= but was still in parser/lexer and m_topic.c 
	  removed. Also added code to hide the always present topic u@h 
	  if chide is on.  

2000-12-20 11:02  db

	* src/ircdauth.c: connect timeout problem fixed 

2000-12-20 01:10  db

	* src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, tools/convertconf.c: 
	- fixed convertconf to bring it in line with current conf file
	  format it does a reasonable first pass job, though you still might
	  need to tweak..  
	
	- We were missing "shared" keyword in new conf file. This is vaguely
	  worded to allow us to support "shared klines" "shared locops" etc.
	  should we choose to do so... If I had time, I would extend it to
	  allow specification of remote user@host as well... and whether it
	  applies to klines/locops/unkline etc. shared resources...  
	
	- provided I hear back from adrian after a successful conversion of 
	  his conf file, I'm going to nuke most of the gook in oldparser.c 
	  so it only deals with 'D' and 'K' lines.. I'll likely rename it as
	  well kdparser.c maybe..  
	
	- parse.c has a bug. but its late for me, I'll look at it after some
	  sleep maybe is- and I can look at it together. The problem is
	simple...  
	
	ISON nick1 nick2 nick3...... nick20 
	
	all nicks at 15 to 20 should go into the last parv[] not be
	truncated... at a space. Otherwise we break ISON for sure, and 
	likely other things...  
	
	- Adrian can you move logs into /logs from /etc ? pretty please? ;) 

2000-12-19 22:59  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c:

	  link server...  

2000-12-19 20:43  db

	* modules/m_invite.c, src/client.c: 
	- fixed double free in invites 
	- fixed prefix botch in m_invite() using sendto_anywhere() 
	  but adding a prefix myself. oops. sendto_anywhere does its own
	  prefixes.

	  It won't compile like that

	* modules/m_away.c, modules/m_join.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c,
	src/channel.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c, src/send.c: 
	- lazylinks final form. New nicks introduced after the burst, are 
	  simply passed on. The reason is simple. SJOIN would have to be
	  modifed to pass new nicks onto ll servers, and its a pita. SJOIN
	  needs more rewriting before I attempt that. ugh. So for now, any new
	  nicks that join the network, get propogated to the LL leaf as
	  normal. The hub does not burst nicks at all, it bursts channel back
	  ON request of a cburst from the ll server, as it does so, it SJOIN's
	  the nicks needed as well as SJOINing the channels requested. Nicks
	  that are on the server but not sjoin'ed to a channel, will be
	  propogated to the LL leaf when they join a channel, not before. i.e.
	  if you are nick A on hub HUBA you will not be nick propogated to the
	  leaf until you join a channel, or you /quit and rejoin the network.
	  Simple? Capiche?

	* include/numeric.h, modules/core/m_quit.c, src/messages.tab,

	* include/send.h, modules/m_away.c, modules/m_join.c, src/s_serv.c,
	src/s_user.c, src/send.c: 
	- This completes most of the full LL nick implementation...  
	  nicks unknown to a leaf LL must not have information sent to that
	  LL only when introduced i.e. when they JOIN a channel or are
	  /whois'ed /who'ed etc. are burst onto the LL leaf.  
	  a /msg to a nick that only exists on the hub will fail ATM since 
	  m_message.c is not set up to burst the target nick onto the LL
	  leaf.  However, doing a /whois of the target first, will make the
	  nick available. It will be simple to finish this part.. But after I
	  get some sleep.  

2000-12-18 23:27  db

	* modules/m_cburst.c:

2000-12-18 23:23  db

	* include/send.h, modules/core/m_nick.c, src/send.c: 
	- nick LL are almost there...  
	  Now, nick changes for nicks that the hub does not know about on a
	  leaf ll server are not sent on to that leaf.  
	  This still means a /msg nick where nick is not known yet 
	  will fail, but a /whois will "burst" that nick onto the ll
	  server...  So, privmsg/notify should do a nick burst... ditto on
	  ison Basically what now happens is, the ll server begins to become
	  "aware" of nicks it needs to know about, just not all of them unless
	  it asks the uplink...  

2000-12-18 22:38  ejb

	* src/channel.c:

	* include/s_serv.h, modules/m_cburst.c, modules/m_invite.c,
	modules/m_who.c, modules/m_whois.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- modifed lazylinks partially, to not send a full nick burst..  
	  still some work to do on this..  
	- added client_burst_if_needed() ... it checks to see if the given 
	  server pointer is a server, is a lazylink, and if it does not 
	  know about that given client, it bursts the nick.  
	- A nick that is not known on a leaf, will be nick collided ! if it 
	  changes nick. Thats next folks.. removing the sending of nick 
	  changes to leafs that don't know about that nick.

	be changed.

	* include/client.h, include/ircd.h, include/s_serv.h,
	modules/m_cburst.c, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- ok. redid the way the bitmaps were cleared for lazylinks.  
	  the old code walked all the global channels, clearing the 
	  lazyLinkChannelExists bitmap of the leaf servers bit.. Now the
	  code keeps track of which channels/clients have these bits set,
	  and only walks those lists when a lazy link server quits.  
	  This adds new lists to ircd.c, new bitmap to client struct, new
	  call in m_cburst.c .. client.c modded to call
	  remove_lazyLink_flags() new code added in s_serv.c to add
	  remove_lazylink_flags() and to add add_lazylinkchannel() and
	add_lazylinkclient() functions to s_serv.c

	- changed all file_open() and file_close() calls to fbopen() and
	fbclose() 
	- changed all write()s to fbputs()s 
	- updated dependancy file 
	- added strerror() msgs to failed file i/o logs/server notices

	  the command is available from msg->cmd, so why duplicate it? lead to

	- added einride and hwy to credits, give them some vanity.  
	- fileio.c had an obvious bug, but we never used fbgetc() so it
	  didn't matter. pro is going to look at the ircu version, to see if
	  we can fold that one back in without issues.

	  re-arrangement nonsense in the original code. This is long gone..

	- moved gline expiration to be an event started from ircd.c at
	  startup right now its run every half hour. That should be
	sufficient.  
	
	- also cleanedup s_gline.c s_gline.h m_gline.c while at it. Removed 
	  unnecessary and obsolete extern definitions. Made a couple of
	  functions static. Found a duplicate definition for glines in
	s_conf.c! 
	
	- Fixed LazyLink join to a non existing channel on the hub. The 
	  hub has to actually create the channel but not SJOIN it to
	  anything.  Then the hub can mark this channel as a lazy link
	  channel with the leaf being "interested" in knowing about the
	  channel. The timestamp should be set to the highest possible time,
	  so its always overruled. It also should be expired if necessary.i.e.
	  lazy link server dies after doing cburst request but before received
	  LLJOIN.  Removed the useless lazylink references in m_join.c duh.

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_join.c, modules/m_lljoin.c,
	modules/m_oper.c, src/channel.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- lazy link lljoin was relying on can_join which needed to be moved
	  into channel.c from m_join.c 
	- applied einrides conf changes, which will remove the original I
	  line conf from an oper replacing it with the new one.

	  less The nicks are SJOIN'ed one nick at a time to the leaf, That
	  should be fixed.  
	- new channel creation has a glitch somewhere, the LLJOIn isn't 
	  being seen by the client, and it has to do a double join. hrmmmpf 

2000-12-16 11:19  db

	* include/handlers.h, modules/m_list.c:

2000-12-16 10:58  db

	* include/irc_string.h, src/irc_string.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	        Included here is a patch which adds the function strip_tabs 
	        to irc_string.c; the function converts all found tabs to 
	        spaces, while copying the string.  
	
	        The reason I wrote this is because in h7, when HUPd or 
	        /REHASHd, the server will show opers any bad lines it 
	        finds in ircd.conf.  Most of these lines start with tab, 
	        so, displaying the actual tab character is irritating for 
	        users who use something other than an ircii derivative.  
	
	        It applies to ircd-hybrid-7-20001216-103810.tar.gz, which 
	        adrian gave me this morning.  I tested it, and it's being 
	        used on hybrid.best.net's test H7 server.  
	
	        Another function which might be useful would be one which 
	        squeezes excessive whitespace into just one space itself 
	        (eg. tr/ / /s (or "     " --> " ")).

	* include/ircd.h, include/s_serv.h, modules/m_cburst.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- fixed lazy links. I was trying to use the extended "join new nick 
	  to network" SJOIN instead of the simpler "join this nick to
	  channel" SJOIN oops. That would collide everyone. Sooo that
	  involved a pile of fixes and new functions to properly send SJOIN
	  channel. Might be able to simplify reduce recyle functions later...  
	
	- Oh documented a few more globals in ircd.c and ircd.h, also
	  removed a couple of references to no longer existing variables.. LRV
	etc.  

2000-12-16 01:48  adrian

	* doc/Makefile.in: 
	
	Add a blank line after the distclean: tag, so make knows its a blank 
	target.  

2000-12-15 22:58  db

	* modules/core/m_mode.c: 
	- ask for MODE on channel if LL

	* modules/m_accept.c, modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_ison.c,
	modules/m_kline.c, modules/m_knock.c, modules/m_unkline.c,
	modules/m_userhost.c, src/modules.c, src/s_user.c: . let opers see
	full /lusers report even if server-hide is on . parse() can check
	the number of params for a lot of m_commands 

2000-12-15 21:42  db

	* modules/core/m_mode.c, src/channel.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- m_mode.c had some twisted logic. Corrected. *duh* 
	- did some variable renaming in channel.c chname instead of
	"real_name" 
	- fixed two bugs pointed out and corrected with Walter Campbell in 
	  I and D line handling. notably, the conf host string wasn't being
	  updated.  

2000-12-15 18:55  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- fix for gecos blocks submitted by Walter Campbell 

2000-12-15 16:26  db

	* doc/example.conf, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- added patch contributed by Walter Campbell, it adds connectfreq 
	  to a class block. Note, it is a synonym for class_number_per_ip 

2000-12-15 12:55  db

	* modules/m_help.c, modules/m_stats.c, src/parse.c, src/s_serv.c,
	src/send.c:

	- removed an extra space in parse.c 

2000-12-15 12:45  db

	- missing clean: target in Makefile.in for doc 

2000-12-15 12:30  db

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, src/ircd.c: 
	- added GLINE_PATH gline.log missing from config.h ircd.c 

2000-12-15 12:01  db

	* modules/m_unkline.c: 
	- missing parc check in m_ungline

	* include/client.h, modules/m_connect.c, modules/m_svinfo.c,
	src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- a few changes to hide ip's of servers even from opers, given the 
	  new world order *sigh* on EFnet...  

2000-12-15 06:04  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- tiny tweak to send_capabilities to clean it up 

2000-12-15 01:10  db

	* modules/m_eob.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- I didn't get it right.  
	  So for now, just set the eob flag for later use.  

2000-12-15 01:04  db

	* include/client.h, modules/m_eob.c, modules/core/m_sjoin.c,
	src/s_serv.c: 
	- I think I got this right.  
	  EOB message now sets flag in server struct saying its sent EOB, 
	  if EOB is set in struct in sjoin, warning message is sent out 
	  about HACK 

2000-12-14 23:27  toot

	* modules/m_whowas.c: fixed some bent logic in whowas 

2000-12-14 23:03  db

	- removed obsolete BUFFERPOOL from config.h and m_info.h 

2000-12-14 22:09  toot

	* src/s_user.c: replaced some stuff that'd gone missing in
	slow_lusers 

2000-12-14 21:53  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- redid parse.c do_numeric, thats where our remote stats bug was..  
	  I was adding an extra ':' where I shouldn't have been. duh.  

2000-12-14 20:59  db

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- don't count opers again in /stats L

	include/config.h.dist, include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/match.c, src/s_user.c: . moved dots_in_ident
	to an ircd.conf option . removed some d_line remains..  

2000-12-14 19:28  db

	* include/handlers.h, include/msg.h, src/modules.c: 
	- added modlist admins can now list all loaded modules.  

2000-12-14 17:46  spookey

	* modules/m_challenge.c: Minor _version misplacement.. (above the
	#else ,  not below it =P) 

2000-12-14 17:11  toot

	* doc/server-version-info, include/config.h, include/config.h.dist,
	include/m_info.h, include/numeric.h, src/s_debug.c: ripped out some
	more unused stuff 

2000-12-14 16:06  db

	* modules/m_stats.c, src/s_gline.c: 
	- missing show_opers in m_stats.c found by Walter Campbell 
	- duplicate end of stats in gline pointed out by toot 

2000-12-14 14:56  toot

	* include/config.h: undid accidental config.h change :P 

2000-12-14 14:55  toot

	* doc/example.conf, include/config.h, include/s_conf.h,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: removed some unused things
	(quiet_on_ban, and moderate_nick_change left overs) 

2000-12-14 13:48  db

	* modules/m_stats.c: 
	- missing show_opers(sptr) in m_stats.c found by Walter Campbell 

2000-12-14 12:59  db

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_gline.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- removed a bunch of useless B line stuff 
	- put sanity test into m_gline.c so it wont' core on a NULL
	glinefile 

2000-12-14 11:11  db

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- YOU missed an #endif toot! ;) 

2000-12-14 10:53  db

	* src/modules.c: 
	- trivial move of basename() to save a free() if not an admin 

2000-12-14 10:38  toot

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, src/ircd.c: cleaned some
	PATH stuff a bit 

2000-12-14 10:04  db

	* doc/technical/send.txt, include/config.h, include/s_serv.h,
	modules/m_cburst.c, modules/m_kline.c, src/class.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/s_serv.c: 
	- removed find_class(0) from m_kline.c was never used, no one ever 
	  referred to the class on a kline, BLOAT gone.  
	- /rehash caused opering clients to core server, traced to an
	  incorrect find_class(0) 0 should return "default" class not 0. found
	by einride.  
	- first fixes to lazy links, don't use , it nick collides everyone 
	  still needs fixes 

2000-12-13 21:53  db

	* modules/m_admin.c: 
	- HUB info does not belong in m_admin.c 

2000-12-13 21:19  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- fixed typo spotted by Walter Campbel in oper_admin 

2000-12-13 20:34  db

	* src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- fixed small typo in the parser, spotted by Walter Campbell 

2000-12-13 20:27  spookey

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: 
	
	  --disable-openssl enabled openssl... that didn't seem right..  

2000-12-13 20:05  db

	* doc/technical/send.txt: 
	- tiny update to send.txt, sendto_common_channels 

2000-12-13 16:41  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- Ok the mystery of the missing NICK has been solved. (hwy/toot?) 
	  If you weren't on a channel and you did a nick change, you never
	  got a nick change from the server. oops.  
	  Its poorly documented in the old sources... ick...
	  sendto_common_channel says its not supposed to send to the
	  originator, but yet it does ...  *sigh* 

2000-12-13 16:20  db

	* include/msg.h, include/parse.h, modules/m_help.c,
	modules/m_stats.c, src/parse.c: 
	- when msgtab went away, due to the hash table replacement, 
	  m_stats.c, m_help.c had to be rewritten. I had to add a new 
	  report command in parse. I stumbled across an apparent compiler
	  bug..  the hash table is defined to be 387 entries, but the report
	  function was walking in to the poll fd lists at 385... Something is
	  screwy here perhaps a rounding error? In any case, thats why the
	  weird +10 in parse.c msg_hash_table[MAX_MSG_HASH+10]; 

2000-12-13 15:26  db

	* include/parse.h, src/ircd.c, src/parse.c: 
	- ripped out the trie (tree parse) code that Roger wrote. Too hard
	  to debug for now. Replaced with a simplistic (very) hash table. The
	  hash function is =horrid= for now.  

2000-12-13 14:04  adrian

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	
	How'd I forget to pre-initialise linebuf_initialised to 0? Its
	implied due to it being a global variable, but _still_ ..  

2000-12-13 12:58  db

	* doc/example.conf, modules/m_invite.c, src/s_gline.c: 
	- removed an obsolete line from the example.conf 
	- added s_gline.c that I forgot 

2000-12-13 12:53  toot

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, modules/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in: fixed some makefile stuff 

2000-12-13 09:08  db

	* include/s_conf.h, include/s_gline.h, modules/m_cburst.c,
	modules/m_challenge.c, modules/m_gline.c, modules/m_invite.c,
	modules/m_rehash.c, modules/m_set.c, modules/m_stats.c,
	src/Makefile.in, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/modules.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- I had changed RTLD_LAZY to RTLD_NOW in modules.c thus insisting 
	  on all names being resolved before loading. oops. should have done
	  this earlier. pile of undeffed at run time names, mostly typos; 
	  but a few clear dependancies such as m_stats depending on stuff
	  loaded only by m_gline ... sooo moved much of that in s_gline.c
	  since s_conf.c is quite large enough thankyou.  
	- also redid m_invite.c so it will show the right channel name on an 
	  invite to a vchan. removed the silly message to channel stuff on
	  invites, it was referring to a no longer defined function
	  anyway... BLOAT totally removed the need to be chanop before sending
	  an invite, hence modified the lexer/parser to remove that option
	  totally BLOAT removed the need to be +i before adding the invite
	  block. who cares.  BLOAT 

2000-12-13 01:04  db

	* doc/example.conf: 
	- typo, it should be "server" not "servers" in class 

2000-12-13 00:57  db

	* modules/core/m_sjoin.c, modules/m_stats.c, src/channel.c,
	src/s_serv.c: 
	- halfops wasn't being propogated by sjoin, so added quick change 
	  to pass the halfop along 
	- however... also added code to send halfops along as normal peons
	  for now they still will have their halfops respected on their
	  server, just no one else will notice. There should be a CAP_HALFOP
	added...  
	- tidied up and added more comments to m_stats.c 

2000-12-12 23:09  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- urgh stupid typo sorry ! sorry sorry sorry! 

2000-12-12 22:37  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- msg_tree_root has to be zero'ed in clear_msg_tree() or it causes 
	  odd problems esp. on redhat linux for some reason. NO idea why 
	  but the stray pointers left in it caused it to core nicely.  

2000-12-12 18:31  db

	* src/: client.c, s_serv.c: OH WHAT A BLASTED PITA 
	- Ok... a CONNECTING server must put the server its trying to
	  connect to on the serv_list because its going to blindly send its
	  server burst to its new uplink. But the server its connecting to is
	  not strictly a server yet until the handshake is over ... oy 
	  SO, the connecting to server is put on the serv_list, so the
	  connect burst will go through, but it might not be a server yet if
	  the connection fails, so... I have to check on the server list as
	  well as the unregisterd list to pull it off (in
	exit_client/client.c).. ugh ugh ugh...  
	- This breaks all the state information in ->state ugh.  
	  A leaf server has a client (the one its connecting to) already in
	  its serv_list (remember?) sooo it can no longer simply check for a
	  non empty serv_list to allow a connection or not. NOOOO it now has
	  to make sure that server in that list is the same one its trying to
	  connect to.  (in serv_establish/s_serv.c) UGH UGH UGH 

2000-12-12 16:07  adrian

	* include/config.h, modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	tools/Makefile.in: 
	
	Do build magick in the binary. Now, --prefix="foo" is reflected in
	DPATH and is also reflected in the various PATH's there are.  
	
	The handling of the ETCDIR stuff is ugly and warrants instant death
	in my eyes, but it works and it doesn't cause me to retch when I
	look at it so I guess it can stay there until Someone Else(tm) fixes
	it.  
	
	Note that IRCD_PREFIX needs to be defined during the ircd and tools
	build.  I *did* try doing the squid thing - take config.h, pass a
	sed script over it to map DPATH to @prefix@, and do it that way, but
	it might have made some people throw up.  
	
	This completes tonights set of work which I just shouldn't have
	done.  Comments can be piped through cvs commit.  

2000-12-12 14:46  adrian

	* Makefile.in, configure, autoconf/configure.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	doc/ircd.motd, doc/kline.conf, include/setup.h.in,
	modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, tools/Makefile.in: 
	
	The very first step in sanifying the make and install process 
	
	* move opers.txt into doc like it bloody should have been 
	* make install work with each subdir's Makefile rules, rather than 
	  install_ircd 
	* create placeholders (blank) for ircd.motd and kline.conf 
	
	Its all far too complex to explain. Suffice to say, its neater.  
	Binaries and some of the config files (not the kline, motd) are 
	renamed to .old as a backup.  
	
	Now, do the binary ..  

2000-12-12 10:25  db

	* include/client.h, src/client.c, src/irc_string.c, src/ircdauth.c: 
	- folded in Walter Campbell's IPV6 patches 

2000-12-12 09:36  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c, modules/core/m_part.c,
	modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- verified the generated prefixes on a number of files 
	- umm the big bug was in serv_connect_callback() the newly connected
	  =to= server was not being put on the serv_list... This mean that
	  SJOIN's were not being propogated to a =connected to= server since
	  the connectee had no idea it was supposed to.  
	
	  This was sorta obvious when /stats v returned 0 servers, and the 
	  serv_list was 0 

2000-12-11 23:16  db

	* modules/m_stats.c, src/client.c: 
	- fixed stupid bug in m_stats.c, acptr wasn't being set...  

2000-12-11 22:45  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- oops. forgot to generate a prefix in sendnick_TS in s_serv.c 

2000-12-11 22:11  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- don't core if a server is not found on the serv_list 

2000-12-11 22:03  db

	* modules/m_trace.c: 
	- fixed m_trace.c so as to not use local[] 

2000-12-11 21:43  db

	* modules/core/m_die.c: 
	- fixed m_die.c to not use local[] 

2000-12-11 21:34  db

	* modules/m_close.c: 
	- not sure if I am closing all the fd's that should be closed here..  
	  the original code refers to connecting servers as well as
	  unknown_clients perhaps connecting server fd's should be also
	closed? 

2000-12-11 21:29  db

	* modules/m_stats.c, src/client.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- a client being made into a server, should be removed from the
	  unknown_list this was happening in the new server establish code...  
	  This left an unknown client hanging around, not removed from
	  unknown_list because it was now a server, not an unknown client.  
	
	- local removal was missed in m_stats.c, this meant /stats didn't
	  work since it was never loaded. There are three other functions that
	  have to be fixed as well... m_trace.c, m_die.c, m_close.c 

2000-12-11 20:18  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- tiny comment fix in check_pings 

2000-12-11 19:40  db

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	- how did THAT get back in. removed local[] again *sigh* 

2000-12-11 19:32  db

	* modules/m_ison.c: 
	- simple re-work to m_ison.c, rfc1489 is ambigious about how this
	  should be handled...  
	
	The ISON command was implemented to provide  a  quick  and 
	   efficient means  to get a response about whether a given nickname
	   was currently on IRC. ISON only takes one (1) parameter: a
	   space-separated list of nicks.  For  each  nickname in the list that
	   is present, the server adds that to its reply string.  Thus the
	   reply string may return empty (none  of  the given  nicks are
	   present), an exact copy of the parameter string (all of them
	   present) or as any other subset of the set of nicks  given  in  the
	   parameter.  The only limit on the number of nicks that may be
	   checked is that the combined length must not be too large as to
	   cause the server to chop it off so it fits in 512 characters.  ...  
	   Examples: 
	
	   ISON phone trillian WiZ jarlek Avalon Angel Monstah 
	                                   ; Sample ISON request for 7
	                                   nicks.  
	
	...  
	  But the parser will break those up into parv[1] ......  
	
	  And the parser only presently handles 8 .. so Monstah wouldn't be
	  parsed...  oops.  
	
	  Mirc apparently sends them "ISON nick1 nick2 nick3" 
	  But other clients must be sending them with a ':' to force parsing 
	of space separated nicks into one parv[1] (?) 
	
	  It appears that thats how hybrid-5 expects it. It has to come in as 
	"ISON : nick1 nick2 nick3" to force "nick1 nick2 nick3" into parv[1]
	! 
	
	  In any case, this code =should= handle both interpretations.  

2000-12-11 19:10  db

	* doc/technical/send.txt, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- removed the last remnant of local[], was one hidden in s_serv.c 
	  the definition for it was hiding in s_bsd.c 

2000-12-11 17:28  db

	* doc/technical/send.txt, include/s_stats.h, modules/Makefile.in,
	modules/m_stats.c, src/s_stats.c, src/send.c: 
	- renamed send_channel_members to sendto_list_anywhere, to remain
	  consistent in send.c with sendto_list_local. This really means we
	  =could= set up the "GROUP" idea Roger postulated ages ago... Roger
	  suggested something like this "NGROUP foo" "GROUP foo
	  nick1,nick2,nick3" privmsg to foo, sends to nick1,nick2,nick3 ... I
	  suppose foo would have to have disambiguitating prefix like $ so one
	  could set up a group of users you wanted to talk to often..  
	
	- fixed s_stats.c to be consistent in only needing the client
	  pointer passed, not both a client pointer and a nick.  
	
	- reverted to old CC options in modules -g -O2 etc.  

2000-12-11 16:47  db

	* src/: client.c, s_stats.c: 
	- removed some unused variables 

2000-12-11 16:20  db

	* src/: client.c, s_user.c: 
	- unknown clients should be removed from the unknown_list on exit! 
	  or you get duplicates on the unknown_list and neat things like
	  that.  

2000-12-11 15:07  db

	* include/ircd.h, modules/m_ison.c, modules/core/m_nick.c,
	src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c,
	src/s_stats.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- this gets rid of local[] 
	  unknown clients are now placed into unknown_list, moved to 
	  serv_list (local servers only) and lclient_list (local client
	  list) as appropriate. check_pings now scans the lclient_list,
	  serv_list and then checks for unknown clients timing them out as
	  appropriate.  Now, the proper place to do PING checks is in s_bsd.c
	  in comm_checktimeouts() using a timeout_handler (as pointed out by
	  Adrian) ... Someone will have to check that unknown clients 
	  are also on this list, and get rid of that fixed sized fd_table...  
	
	- Seems I screwed up the inter-server NICK prefix and message , this 
	  caused all sorts of neat nick collides.  

2000-12-11 14:02  davidt

	* messages/create_po, src/numeric.c: oops, didn't cvs add

	* modules/: m_eob.c, core/m_squit.c: 
	- m_eob.c was not reporting length of burst like it should have been 
	- m_squit.c I forgot to send out WALLOPS when squit matched local
	  link NOT fully tested 'cause I need a remote server to split! 

2000-12-10 21:54  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: 
	- CAP_CHW works again between compatible CAP_CHW servers..  
	  Thats the /quote privmsg @#channel :message 
	  functionality borrowed from dalnet/ircnet? 
	
	Pending BUGS; 
	  - /msg $#hostmask is still broken across servers 
	  - /squit of a remote server appears to be broken 
	
	Pending re-work: 
	  - check_pings()/check_kline() should be reworked so as not to use
	    a fixed size array...  

2000-12-10 21:06  db

	  this necessitated changes to send.c send.h send.txt 
	  m_connect.c m_locops.c m_operwall.c m_squit.c m_wallops.c

	- cleaned up m_gline.c, STILL untested.  
	- removed unnecessary lines in ircd_parser.y due to removed botcheck 
	- only show stats 'G' to opers 
	- updated opers.txt, client.c to show leaving servers as well as 
	  being introduced servers.  
	- cleanup_channels() wasn't being restarted when server was a hub, 
	  it should be always run now, to expire persistent channels.

	- went through and removed a bunch of unused variables 
	- fixed sendto_channel_butone, need to generate both local and

	- updated send.txt to include info on prefixes.

	* include/send.h, modules/m_invite.c, modules/core/m_kill.c,
	modules/core/m_message.c, src/parse.c, src/send.c: 
	- sendto_prefix_one is =gone= 
	- sendto_one should be used for local clients only, with prefix 
	  pre-built at time of use.  
	- sendto_anywhere is a somewhat saner replacement for
	  sendto_prefix_one (I think) it should be used ONLY when target
	  client is unknown whether its local or remote, it will build the
	  appropriate prefix itself in that case. This makes it less efficient
	than sendto_one..  
	- I kludged send_message_remote() for now... adrian you might want 
	  to look at that... maybe we can get away with just always calling 
	  send_message() or add a short common function or something...  
	  send_message() should be for local clients (not servers(? only(?) 
	  perhaps i.e. send_message_local() and send_message_remote() 
	  sendto_one should be renamed sendto_local() (sendto_local_client) 
	  sendto_remote (sendto_remote_client) sendto_anywhere() sends to
	  either...  Too tired right now..  
	
	BUGS pending...  
	1) the horrid /msg $#host.mask to clients on remote servers is
	   =broken= for now.  (it works locally) 
	2) sendto @# chanop style messages is =broken= to remote servers for
	now.  
	3) Probably more *yawn*

	  sendto_realops() to call "sendto_realops_flags(FLAGS_ALL..." but
	  that level of obsfuscuation I don't like.. soooooo I converted all
	  sendto_realops to use sendto_realops_flags(FLAGS_ALL ... *fun*

	- ok. in the new world order... prefixes are generated at the top
	  level instead of being grunged out in send.c... This gets rid of
	  incredible idiotic connipations that were happening in send.c...
	  I've only done this for =LOCAL= sent to server messages so far,
	  hence ALL uses of sendto_channel_local you must work out your own
	  prefix. Its not hard, and is worth the bother. This modified a bunch
	of modules.  
	
	- I have also preformatted the stupid string to be sent to each
	  client in sendto_channel_local AT the top instead of re-formatting
	  it each and every time a message is sent to a client. like *duh*

	  meanwhile, all JOIN's by remote clients look "weird" as they are 
	  missing their user@host prefixes...

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c: 
	
	
	* add bufhead->numlines and linebuf_numlines() - this implements
	  line count tracking so you can see how many lines are being used
	  (complete/incomplete) in the linebuf. Now people can implement
	linecount flooding.  
	
	* update bufhead->len correctly. It was being done in
	  linebuf_flush() but not linebuf_get() which meant that the recvq
	  would grow, and the flood protection (which used linebuf_line()
	  rather than linebuf_allocline() until about 5 minutes ago) would
	eventually kick off a user.  
	
	  Now the tracking is done in linebuf_done_line() where it should have
	  been all along. Honestly, the crack I must've been smoking then ..

2000-12-07 21:25  adrian

	* src/packet.c: 
	
	Use linebuf_alloclen() rather than linebuf_len() for flood tracking.

	which can be just as annoying.

	  for remote joins, but getting there.  
	- allow halfops to +imtsp channels like full ops 

2000-12-06 21:37  db

	* modules/m_kline.c, modules/m_userhost.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- reverted previous m_kline.c change in favour of...  
	- letting s_conf.c figure out if the oper placing the kline is
	  remote oper or not, and logging it appropriately.  

2000-12-06 20:22  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c: 
	- cleaned up m_server.c some more. ugh. it was horrid 

2000-12-06 18:42  db

	* modules/m_accept.c, src/channel.c, src/vchannel.c: 
	- riedel's patch to keep from adding nicks twice to an accept list 

2000-12-06 17:52  db

	* messages/custom.po, src/messages.tab, src/vchannel.c: 
	- redoing RPL_VCHANLIST so last %s is gone, since I'm building 
	  up the channel sublist myself 

2000-12-06 17:23  db

	* modules/m_accept.c: 
	- m_accept was using the wrong numeric for "no such nick" 

2000-12-06 16:34  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- ummm there is a bug where an struct Confitem aconf will have a
	  NULL c_class (pointer to class) this will core the server in
	  attach_iline this should be fixed, meanwhile... validate the pointer
	  is non NULL before trying to dereference it for now.  

2000-12-06 15:40  db

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- transposed user/host in m_kline.c 

2000-12-06 15:32  db

	* modules/m_capab.c: 
	- m_capab.c was missing an MFLG_UNREG hence was never being called 
	  in some cases. oops 

2000-12-06 14:54  db

	* modules/core/m_server.c:

2000-12-06 14:01  db

	- added mr_capab to handlers.h 
	- changed m_capab to use mr_capab, remember capabilities are sent 
	  while client is still unregistered 
	- fixed another parser bug pointed out by Walter Campbell 
	- added sanity test to del_all_accepts

	* include/channel.h, modules/core/m_message.c, src/channel.c,
	src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- reworked anti channel flooding to allow chanops/voice to flood 
	  their own channel with impunity. This will allow them to at least 
	  set +m if the channel really is flooded! 
	- fixed parser error spotted by Walter Campbel (Hwy101) 

2000-12-06 02:49  db

	* include/client.h, src/client.c, src/packet.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- on_accept_list can be on a remote client, having it on the
	  localClient part will lead to a core..  
	- hacked out a portion of adrian's flood control for now.. to get 
	  the darn thing to do a server link. I'll look at it in the morning 
	  when I am awake.  

2000-12-05 20:28  db

	* TODO, include/client.h, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- updated TODO 
	- c lines were blasted when ZIPLINKS were removed, put them back 
	  as normal C lines for now 
	- up check ping event time to 30 seconds 
	- close fbfile after parsing in .include 
	- check for NULL find on strchr('\n') in initconf 

2000-12-05 19:31  db

	modules/core/m_message.c, modules/m_set.c, src/ircd.c:

	  message throttling, both appear to work. Removed FLOODTIME, default
	  to always one second for now.  

2000-12-05 14:31  db

	* modules/m_set.c:

	- sprinkled some asserts into linebuf.c 
	- fixed typo in m_admin.c 

2000-12-05 10:41  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/class.c, src/linebuf.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- cleaned up class.c adding more comment blocks 
	- cleaned up s_conf.c to actually use nice defines instead of
	cryptic #'s 
	- fixed typo in linebuf.c 

2000-12-05 04:50  toot

	src/ircd.c, src/messages.tab, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- updated opers.txt for h7, its more or less right now 
	- added new 'u' flag for opers, show unauth clients on that flag
	  instead of 'c' flag 
	- moved 'u' flag to 'g' for CALLERID 
	- upped flooding parms slightly some more... still set too low I
	think 
	- changed DRONE_FLOOD etc. to plain FLOOD... This is generic anti 
	  flooding code for the =recipient=

	* include/s_debug.h, include/s_misc.h, messages/custom.po,
	modules/m_stats.c, src/messages.tab, src/s_debug.c, src/s_misc.c: 
	- cleaned up these functions, two arguments when 1 is quite enough 
	  this makes them consistent with other functions that only pass 
	  the struct Client *sptr. No need to also pass the nick.  
	- changed wording on vchan's at toyota's suggestion.  

2000-12-04 22:45  db

	* include/client.h, modules/m_accept.c, modules/core/m_message.c,
	src/client.c: 
	- added rest of accept code.  
	  client puts themselves into +u mode, this disallows casual
	  messages to that client. The source gets a "am on server side
	  ignore" from the target, the target gets a message saying source has
	  messaged them, but paced to once a minute.  
	  a client in +u mode (or any other mode actually) can add clients 
	  it will accept messages from using /quote accept nick 
	  delete them using /quote accept -nick (perhaps /quote delete nick
	  would make more sense?) a list with /quote accept *

	* include/client.h, include/send.h, modules/m_kline.c,
	src/client.c, src/send.c: 
	- found the cause of the blalloc bit already cleared error..  
	  dlink_node was already been cleared in remove_user_from_channel 
	  exit_one_client was trying to also free it.  
	- added sendto_cap_serv_butone for sending to capable servers 
	  added rudimentary remote kline code to use this. NOT TESTED 
	  until I get a remote server up.  

2000-12-04 19:53  db

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_kline.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- removed duplicate function from m_kline.c replaced with function 
	  already in place but unused in s_conf.c duh. can we say BLOAT? 

2000-12-04 19:24  db

	* include/client.h, include/m_info.h, src/packet.c: 
	- fixed bug in parse_client_queued to do with opered clients.  
	  code was nver resetting lcptr->sent_parsed = 0 and actually_read =
	  0 so poor oper would no longer be listened to after a while...  
	  Replaced goto with a if (!IsPrivileged... macro...  
	- removed last remnants of USER_UH defines ... GONE 

2000-12-04 13:36  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- don't devoice/voice if chanop 

2000-12-04 12:52  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- identity of who set a ban should be hidden in channel op hide mode 

2000-12-04 12:32  db

	* src/vchannel.c: 
	- empty vchans shown on list have no clients to key off of, 
	  return a timestamp for now. You can't join them still since 
	  the join code doesnt' know anything about joining on a ts key.  

2000-12-04 12:07  db

	* include/class.h, src/class.c: 
	- class.c get_client_class returns a string class name now 
	  It was trying to use a struct ConfItem as a class pointer. oops.  
	  As conf's now have a pointer to the class name anyway, its easier 
	  to pull it from the conf anyway. If its NULL, return 'default' 
	  string for now.  

2000-12-04 11:30  db

	* modules/core/m_nick.c: 
	- lost a 433 (nickname in use error) somewhere in the way, 
	  put it back in.. m_nick.c 

2000-12-04 10:03  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- had logic wrong in can_send

	* include/client.h, include/packet.h, include/s_bsd.h,
	src/client.c, src/packet.c, src/parse.c, src/s_auth.c: This is a
	patch which implements client send flood protection.  This is the
	type of flood where someone goes 
	
	/join #foo /exec -o cat bigfile.txt 
	
	and they quit with "Excess Flood"  .  
	
	Note that if a client floods, its allow_read value will decrease. If
	they then stop flooding, their allow_read value will increase
	regardless of whether there is any pending data .. this flushes the
	output quicker if and only if they stop flooding.  
	
	I've managed to cause this thing to go tits up a few ways when
	having a client flooding a channel and it gets killed: 
	
	* a blfree bitmap error. Diane, Can you please check out why ? :-) 
	  I think this is related to your Slink death ..  
	
	* Hrm. the "client connecting" notification seems to panic if I'm an
	  oper and see someone connecting to my local server.  
	
	* various strange deaths in the parser.. this one confuses me 
	
	* If a client gets killed for flooding, sometimes you'll see one or
	  two lines *from* that client appear immediately after the exit. This
	  is most probably my problem and its going to be a queue flushing
	issue ..  
	
	Can someone please tidy this up over the next week and commit it?
	I'd like to have a hybrid-7 beta out, and i'm now going to be minus
	some serious time until Christmas.  
	
	Thanks! 
	
	committed for now...

	  NOTE that not everything is working yet, notably server link..  
	  but this doesn't core right away. ;) and appears to run.  

2000-12-01 11:16  davidt

	* doc/technical/message-customisation.txt, include/config.h,
	messages/Makefile.in, messages/custom.po, src/irc_string.c,
	src/numeric.c: fixed gettext support a bit, and added some docs 

2000-12-01 08:03  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	aiee! clear the socket timeout *before* calling the timeout handler.  
	If we clear it after, we miss any timeouts set by the timeout
	handler.  (think multiple-ping checks ..) 

2000-12-01 08:01  adrian

	* include/fdlist.h, src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	add a flush list, which looks precisely like a socket timeout as it
	is right now, but its designed to be used if we want to flush data
	out at a certain time rather than immedidately.  
	
	Think "flood protection".  
	
	Note that this is implemented inside the comm_checktimeouts() loop.  
	This is done because we want to eventually only have exactly *one* 
	walk of the entire fd list/clients once a second, rather than
	multiple.  

2000-11-30 19:52  db

	* include/channel.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c, src/channel.c: 
	- majorly reworked m_sjoin.c remove_our_ops and channel.c
	  send_mode_list because of the original RFC that started this
	  stupidity off, trying to do four modes at a time is risky due to
	  possible buffer overflow ;-( Taking the time to strlen() before
	  adding to output buffer seems CPU intensive to me. soooo back to 3
	  mode changes per. This should speed up sjoin's a lot now.  

2000-11-30 19:02  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- rewrote send_mode_list in channel.c The original was pathetic 
	  strcat this strcpy that. UGH. This should run much faster.  

2000-11-30 17:59  db

	* Makefile.in, include/config.h, modules/core/m_sjoin.c,
	src/channel.c, src/numeric.c: 
	- fixed broken messages stuff for now I'll double check with David
	tomorrow 
	- redid how m_sjoin.c did a remove ops 

2000-11-30 16:20  davidt

	* modules/Makefile.in: m_error.so wasn't being built.  

2000-11-30 16:01  db

	* include/client.h, src/numeric.c: 
	- removed CUSTOM_ERR define no longer needed 
	- removed offsetof no longer needed

	modules/m_set.c, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/messages.tab, src/numeric.c, src/s_conf.c: Removed CUSTOM_ERR,
	and changed it to use gettext(), which allows the message files to
	be changed at run time, currently using /quote set MSGLOCALE ...
	('custom' for the custom messages, or anything else to use the
	standard ircd messages).  Also, added general_message_locale to the
	new config file.  If gettext() isn't available, it should just use
	the standard ircd messages.  

2000-11-30 13:51  db

	* modules/m_names.c: 
	- fixed core bug in m_names.c 

2000-11-30 09:27  adrian

	* include/packet.h, include/s_bsd.h, src/packet.c, src/s_auth.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	
	move read_packet() and parse_client_queued() into packet.c.  s_bsd.c
	is meant to be a place where BSD socket type stuff happens, not
	parsing client messages.  
	
	This is the precursor tidyup which will make implementing the recvq 
	flooding code talk..

	src/s_stats.c, src/s_user.c, src/send.c: 
	- removed the evil local struct Client hack and added a new
	  LocalUser "localClient" part. If non NULL, this client struct is a
	  local client..  I suppose we can now get rid of local_flag? 

2000-11-30 03:28  adrian

	* include/client.h, src/packet.c: 
	
	
	* kill client[] buffer in the Client struct. We don't need this at
	  all with the advent of the linebuf 
	* Tidy up a couple of assert()s to be more tasteful to me 
	* note that the count; entry in the Client struct is now only used
	  to denote local/remote clients with some evil splitting of the
	  client struct and memory allocation. This is evil and should be
	  killed at someone's earliest convienence and replaced with a
	  LocalClient struct which attaches to the end of a struct Client ..  

2000-11-30 03:20  adrian

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	
	
	* added an Id tag 
	* we needed to keep those bzero()'s. Hrm, I wonder why ...  
	  What happened was that we'd have get a line in, and then
	  immediately flush some previously printed garbage. Weird.  

2000-11-30 03:02  db

	* src/modules.c: 
	- similar bug to parse.c in modules.c when increasing moduletable 

2000-11-30 02:53  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l,
	src/ircd_parser.y, src/parse.c: 
	- added two new parms to parser hide_server hide_chanops yes or no 
	- added possible fix (untested by adrian?) to parse.  

2000-11-30 02:04  adrian

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	
	We don't need to bzero, now that the memory routines return the
	memory zero'ed for us ..  

2000-11-30 01:59  db

	* src/: class.c, list.c, listener.c, s_conf.c: 
	- removed memset() 0 after MyMalloc its done already 

2000-11-30 01:56  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- no need to memset to zero in channel.c now either 

2000-11-30 01:54  db

	* include/: msg.h, parse.h: 
	- MessageTree stuff should be in parse.h not msg.h 
	- Seeing as MyMalloc now zeros memory, no need to do it in blalloc 

2000-11-30 01:52  adrian

	* src/irc_string.c: 
	
	bzero() the memory we get from malloc() before returning. This is a
	good thing(tm), and it means we can possibly start removing
	bzero/memset's from around the code.  

2000-11-30 00:54  db

	* modules/: core/m_kick.c, m_links.c: 
	- fixed kick so nonops see user kicking themselves in chanop hide
	mode 
	- don't show uplink on links and hopcount if in server hide mode 

2000-11-30 00:38  db

	  still needs testing 

2000-11-29 22:43  db

	* src/client.c: 
	- server names should not be given in /squit messages if 
	  server hide is turned on 

2000-11-29 22:29  db

	* modules/m_names.c: 
	- squished bug in m_names.c which caused the module to suddenly 
	  throw up when names without a paramter was given. I forgot 
	  the case where a client had no channels it was on, trying to 
	  indirect through a NULL struct Link is bad for the modules health.  

2000-11-29 21:11  db

	* include/channel.h, modules/Makefile.in, modules/m_join.c,
	modules/core/m_squit.c, src/channel.c, src/s_log.c: 
	- fixed m_squit.c 
	- account for LazyLink's in channel.c destroy_channel() 
	  can be used for both persistent channels and lazy links now 
	  removing more BLOAT 
	- -O2 in Makefile.in for modules was doing weirdnesses, hard coded
	to -g for now 

2000-11-29 17:04  db

	* include/client.h, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c:

	src/whowas.c: 
	- pile of cleanups mostly in comments 
	- added persistent channels tentatively for now, finesse it later 
	- redid s_user.c code to clean that up 

2000-11-29 14:18  db

	* include/s_log.h, src/client.c, src/s_log.c, src/s_user.c:

2000-11-29 14:00  db

	* include/s_conf.h, include/s_user.h, src/s_conf.c, src/s_user.c:

	  moved all check for conf/kline notification etc. back into
	  s_conf.c where I think maybe it belongs, in any case, this cleans
	  up register_user no more **char preason. *ugh*

	* include/s_log.h, include/s_user.h, modules/m_lusers.c,
	src/ircdauth.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- redid luser code, removed cache, if this is still needed after all
	  the bug fixes done (!) then add an event to recalculate luser
	counts.  
	
	- added user_welcome() function to s_user.c to start factoring this
	  up I hate monolithic functions...  
	
	  What evil functions lurks in the heart of ircd?, the shad0w knows.  

2000-11-29 11:16  db

	- I removed isbot tests. those are quite obsolete and were BLOAT 
	- I added skeleton for server side ignore new user mode +u 
	- This adds a new command module "m_accept" 
	  This code needs to be finished...  
	- removed rehash gline rehash tkline BLOAT 
	- tidied up linebuf.c to use \r and \n like K&R intended 

2000-11-28 16:38  adrian

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd_poll.c, send.c: 
	
	Revoke FDLIST_BUSYCLIENT for the time being - we need to sort out 
	how we place things in the fd lists, and we need to keep the flow of
	FD events at a steady rate.  
	
	The trouble right now is that if we don't have any idle fd's being 
	triggered, we end up waiting an entire second for their IO to 
	complete. This is too long. :-) 

2000-11-28 16:30  db

2000-11-28 11:57  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c: To quote RFC1459.txt 
	
	The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference 
	   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never
	   be sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to
	   servers too - they must not send any error reply back to the client
	   on receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops 
	   between a client automatically sending something in response to 
	   something it received.  This is typically used by automatons
	   (clients with either an AI or other interactive program
	   controlling their actions) which are always seen to be replying lest
	   they end up in a loop with another automaton.  
	
	NOTICE now no longer replies with "NO SUCH NICK" if a nick recipient 
	does not exist etc.  

2000-11-28 01:44  db

	* modules/core/m_message.c:

2000-11-27 12:29  adrian

	* src/linebuf.c: 
	
	We should only allow a buffer to be obtained via linebuf_get() if it

2000-11-27 12:23  adrian

	* doc/technical/linebuf.txt:

2000-11-27 11:50  db

	* include/handlers.h, include/msg.h, include/parse.h,

2000-11-26 14:17  adrian

	* include/linebuf.h, src/linebuf.c: 
	
	Hrm, return the number of lines parsed by linebuf_parse() - this'll

2000-11-26 12:34  adrian

	src/packet.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_debug.c, src/s_misc.c,
	src/s_user.c, src/send.c: 
	
	Adrian's totally massive evil dbuf die and linebuf code.  
	
	* dbuf.c and dbuf.h have gone. Byebye.  
	* some of the stuff in s_debug.c which reports dbuf stats has been 
	  #if 0'ed for the time being 
	* linebuf flushing (ie write()ing to a socket) is now done through 
	  linebuf_flush() which does the state keeping, saving a whole lot
	  of dbuf map/delete and tracking that existed before 
	* dopacket() was killed, since we now handle line-by-line parsing of
	  both server *and* client recvq buffers. dopacket() did some
	  CRLF-type splitting magic because a single buffer when doing
	  ZIPLINKS could possibly be more than on ircd line.  
	* deliver_it() was also killed, since we don't need that extra
	complexity.  
	* A lot of linebuf fixes are brought in because well, we needed
	them! 
	
	How the linebuf stuff is used (in a nutshell) 
	
	* linebuf_put() is called to put a complete line into a buffer. It
	  has to be a line.  
	* linebuf_parse() is called to put one or more lines into a buffer.  
	  Incomplete lines and multiple lines are handled.  
	* When a line is terminated, it is appended with a CR/LF/NUL .  
	
	  NOTE that the NUL isn't counted in the length! 
	
	Ok - this code is very very alpha. It works, and I can link to
	another hybrid server. There are a lot of extras I have to add to
	this code before it can be used in a public network, like: 
	
	* fixing flood protection to take into account alloclen rather than
	  len.  This is more relevant to memory usage 
	* fix the flood protection to only appear in one place (ie after 
	  linebuf_parse() ) rather than the 10935083405 places it exists now 
	* I should add multiple-size support in the linebuf code, because we
	  might end up wanting to support > 512 line buffers for server
	connections 
	* .. and yes, we should really test this to break it, to make sure I
	  haven't forgotten anything.

	* Makefile.in, include/send.h, modules/m_locops.c,
	modules/m_operwall.c, modules/m_wallops.c, src/send.c:

	* include/config.h: 
	
	 - changed DPATH and the like from "/usr/ejb/ircd/" to

	* modules/m_userhost.c, src/messages.tab: 
	- fixed m_userhost 

2000-11-21 14:31  adrian

	* src/Makefile.in, src/ircd.c, src/linebuf.c, include/linebuf.h: 
	
	Add in the beginnings of my new and hopefully improved dbuf
	replacement.  
	
	The general idea here is that we *should* be pre-parsing buffers
	into lines so we can later throw references around.  
	
	src/dbuf.c throws data into the dbuf and parses it when its coming
	out.  This code parses data into lines when it comes in, so its
	already in a per-line format (minus the trailing CRLFs) when we come
	to parsing it.  
	
	Its building, but I haven't tested it yet. THAT is next.  

2000-11-21 11:42  adrian

	* src/Makefile.in, src/tools.c, include/tools.h: 
	
	Actually create a tools module with stuff that is abused reguarly, 
	and rip some of squid's dlink-list management stuff.  
	
	I'll commit some code which uses them soon, so people have something 
	to work with.  
	
	This should remove a *lot* of ugliness/duplication in dlink list 
	management. :) 

2000-11-20 22:03  db

	* include/config.h, include/handlers.h, include/ircd.h,

	modules/m_who.c, modules/m_whois.c, modules/m_whowas.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/s_serv.c: 
	- general cleanups continue, just a few this time 
	- ltrace removed for now, it can go back in later 

2000-11-19 08:43  davidt

	* modules/Makefile.in, modules/m_motd.c, src/motd.c: modularised
	m_motd, so /MOTD works once again.  motd.c still contains various
	file reading/sending commands, which are used elsewhere, although
	motd.c probably isn't the best name any more.  

2000-11-19 07:45  davidt

	* include/fdlist.h, src/fdlist.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c: fixes for poll.
	It seems to work, although there's probably a bug lurking in there
	somewhere...  

2000-11-18 15:15  toot

	* src/channel.c: removed all those OLD_* defines in set_mode() 

2000-11-18 13:22  toot

	* src/channel.c: End of /NAMES list was missing in one place.  
	fixed compile warning in ltrace 

2000-11-18 10:41  davidt

	* modules/core/: m_nick.c, m_part.c: fix for gcc warnings, and do a
	fd_note on nickchanges.  

2000-11-17 18:02  davidt

	* modules/: m_challenge.c, m_gline.c: 
	- added missing _modinit function to m_gline.c 
	- removed #ifdef LTRACE from m_ltrace.c 
	- fixed m_challenge.c to make a non-broken module if we aren't using 
	  OPENSSL 

2000-11-17 11:02  toot

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/core/m_nick.c, src/channel.c,
	src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/messages.tab: . made a
	  separate ircd.conf setting to block nickchanges when banned, and
	block them in +m chans too, unless opped . fixed a typo i made in
	can_send() :P 

2000-11-16 18:03  toot

	* src/channel.c: (quiet_on_ban stuff) 
	  +o/+v should be able to speak even if banned 
	  only check local connections, to save CPU, and avoid "desync"
	  messages on mixed nets take account of +e's 
	
	it's safe to send more than 3 +b/e/d/I modes on a netjoin, so use
	upto MAXMODEPARAMS 

2000-11-16 17:15  toot

	* include/handlers.h, modules/m_knock.c: removed mo_knock, m_knock
	is fine for opers.  

2000-11-16 16:51  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: use the topic setters nickname in the !list, if
	available 

2000-11-16 14:50  davidt

	* modules/core/m_message.c, src/send.c: 
	- Fixed a small bug in m_message.c, where @@<chan>, @+<chan>,
	  +@<chan>, and ++<chan> would all be treated as +<chan>.  Now @@ and
	  ++ are treated as invalid, @+ and @+ are treated as + 
	- Made sendto_channel_type's check for MODE_VOICE before
	MODE_CHANOP.  
	- m_notice.c and m_privmsg.c are obsolete (merged into m_message.c), 
	  and weren't being built anyway.  

2000-11-16 11:14  davidt

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	- Figured out how to create a .so without the .tmp file..  
	
	this tree seems to compile/run correctly for me on Linux, hopefully 
	I didn't break anything elsewhere..  

2000-11-16 10:52  davidt

	* modules/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	- modules/Makefile.in modified to work with gmake (like
	src/Makefile.in) 
	- src/Makefile.in @DL_OPEN@ removed, since configure doesn't use
	  this any more.  
	- modules/Makefile in removed, since it should be generated by
	  configure like src/Makefile 

2000-11-16 10:28  davidt

	* src/modules.c: Removed uneeded malloc in modules.c (and the
	corresponding bogus free, which caused ircd to core when loading
	modules) 

2000-11-15 19:35  lusky

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in: backed down to previous
	configure script 

2000-11-15 14:24  adrian

	* src/fdlist.c: 
	
	When a FD goes inactive, make sure its moved onto the NONE fdlist.  

2000-11-15 00:51  db

	* include/s_conf.h, modules/m_rehash.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- removed /rehash dump for one reason... and one reason only BLOAT 

2000-11-14 22:34  db

	* modules/: m_whowas.c, core/m_message.c: 
	- oops. just noticed I forgot to cvs add these *sigh* sorry 

2000-11-14 19:18  db

	* autoconf/configure.in, src/parse.c: 
	- small change to parse.c, this makes more sense to me 
	- added configure change suggested by David-T, this still needs to 
	  be made into the configure script by someone who knows how to do 
	  such things...  

2000-11-14 01:08  db

	* include/whowas.h, src/whowas.c: 
	- seriously, why was this struct sitting around not doing anything
	  useful? was it to entertain me? 

2000-11-14 00:40  db

	* TODO, include/handlers.h, include/whowas.h, src/whowas.c: 
	- m_whowas.c was missing from modules, 'cause it was hiding like a
	  bad little boy inside src/whowas.c... unfortuantely, m_whowas.c has
	  a dependancy on whowas.c ... carnal knowledge of the hash table etc.
	  but no worse then m_whois.c on client structs etc. blah. Anyway,
	  move stuff from whowas.c into m_whowas.c in modules..  
	
	- Added NOTICE fix up mention in TODO list 

2000-11-13 23:32  db

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	- A long time ago, in an ircd far far away, there was one a function
	  called m_message.c which did both m_privmsg and m_notice. When the
	  evil bleep bleep from another ircd universe invaded us, we split
	  that into m_privmsg.c and m_notice.c ... I really don't see the
	  point, they share too much functionality, they both do the same
	  thing blah blah blah.  Its really miserable fixing something in
	  m_privmsg.c only to duplicate the work in m_notice.c as well.  

2000-11-13 15:16  db

	* modules/m_cburst.c: 
	- fixed mistake found by David-T an = should have been an |= 

2000-11-13 12:04  db

	* modules/m_userhost.c: 
	- buffer size was incorrect and incorrectly commented 

2000-11-13 09:34  db

	* include/client.h, src/s_conf.c: 
	- fix to s_conf.c *sigh* 

2000-11-13 00:27  db

	* modules/m_who.c: 
	- use more common functions whenever possible. grrr 

2000-11-12 23:08  db

	* include/channel.h, include/config.h, modules/m_list.c,
	modules/core/m_sjoin.c, modules/m_whois.c, src/channel.c,
	src/list.c: 
	- cleaned up m_whois.c a bit more 
	- moved find_user_link from list.c into channel.c thats the only
	  place it was being used anyway.  
	- removed no longer used #ifdef from config.h 
	- redid the semantics for channel_chanop_or_voice to work on channel
	  mode flags rather than Link 

2000-11-11 14:59  db

	* modules/m_kline.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- more cleanup on m_kline.c 
	  with iauth, kline file locking etc. will be handled by iauthd
	  anyway..  We'll need a local link list of klines to place as they
	are handed to iauthd eventually...  
	
	- fixed small bug in s_conf.c removed another #ifdef 

2000-11-11 08:55  db

	* modules/: m_kline.c, m_list.c:

	- fix up Makefiles a bit so they actually work 
	- finally remove src/m_*.c 
	- remove /list sendq crud 

2000-11-11 07:44  db

	* modules/m_kline.c: 
	- simplified mo_dline a bit 

2000-11-11 07:37  db

	* modules/: m_kline.c, m_list.c: 
	- interim checkin of m_kline.c, first pass of clean up 

2000-11-11 06:05  db

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_admin.c, modules/m_list.c,
	src/channel.c, src/send.c: 
	- initial rewrite of m_list.c moved some code into channel.c for the
	  moment.  is- can do a better job on this later (HI!) 
	
	- m_admin now only available locally if unregistered (rodder's fix
	  in 6) this allows one to figure out just who the loser is thats
	  connecting to your server without having to register... yet gets rid
	  of the stupid nick collide "feature" 
	
	- modules/Makefile should really be generated from configure no? for
	  now I've modified modules/Makefile to generate m_list.so again since
	  I've moved some of the depedancies out of m_list.c 
	  is- can figure out what to do with this later. (HI again!) at
	  least the code is sane now. (I've left code #if 0 out in m_list.c
	  so it can go back in later) 

2000-11-10 02:14  db

	* modules/Makefile.in: 
	- added missing m_list.c in Makefile.in 

2000-11-10 02:07  db

	* include/channel.h, modules/m_cjoin.c, modules/m_invite.c,
	modules/m_join.c, modules/m_names.c, src/channel.c: 
	- channel specific stuff should stay in channel.c ya ya ya 
	  anyway, m_join.so was having a nit pick fit over
	  names_on_this_channel() which of course, was way over in
	  m_names.so.... so I have renamed the function to
	  channel_member_names() and placed it into channel.c Ignore the mods
	to src/m_join.c duh. everything m_* in src goes away...  
	
	  Eventually in an universe far far away, channel becomes channel.so 
	  which means, it will have to have a list of dependancies on it to
	  unload and reload or something, or maybe just unload all the m_
	  functions and reload autoload? Sometime in an alternate universe...  

2000-11-10 01:14  db

	* src/parse.c: 
	- nasty DoS 
	  if user enters long prefix, it puts the parser into an infinite
	  loop 
	
	
	:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbwill hang the ircd 

2000-11-09 10:41  ejb

	* include/parse.h, src/ircd.c, src/parse.c: ok basic modules
	support is almost complete now.  there's a strange bug where some
	commands make it exit(1), when i've fixed that all we need is 
	m_modload, and module UNloading support ..  
	
	then maybe modularise more stuff, that's all for the future though.

	mostly working now, apart from a small problem with the mtree that
	means it won't recognise any commands.  m_error and m_list are now
	built as part of the core for now..  still no make install for
	modules/

	m_functions, only 8 left to do now.  most of them will compile,

	Initial commit of loadable modules support.  right now we can load
	modules, but not unload them.  support for adding commands via
	modules is there, and about 50% of the m_*.c has been ported.  
	currently ircd will neither compile nor link properly, but i wanted
	to commit this as soon as possible.. from now on if you modify m_*.c
	please edit the version in modules/ rather than in src/, since
	src/m_*.c will disappear soon.  
	
	i'll try to make another commit tomorrow that fixes compilation, and
	allows ircd to be used ..  
	
	also we need a modules.txt that explains how to write modules.  
	
	so, if you need a working ircd now, sorry, you'll have to wait until
	tomorrow :/ 
	
	(btw if anyone feels like porting the rest of modules/m_*.c (i've
	done up to m_operwall.c so far), just look at one of the existing
	ones as an example, all you need is the struct Message and
	_modinit() function).  as for global symbols defined in modules
	(this is why ircd won't link right now), i have a solution to this
	which i can hopefully also commit tomorrow.  

2000-11-08 13:36  adrian

	* doc/technical/network.txt: 
	
	
	* Adding socket timeout information 
	* remove FD list code, since its in a seperate file 
	* cosmetic changes 

2000-11-08 12:57  adrian

	* doc/technical/: fd-management.txt, file-management.txt,
	network.txt: 
	
	Break out the documentation in network.txt into seperate files for 
	filedescriptor management and file management.  

2000-11-08 12:55  adrian

	* src/fileio.c: 
	
	Enforce FD limits in file_open() 

2000-11-08 12:54  adrian

	* doc/technical/network.txt: 
	
	Updates on the network code documentation. Add documentation for the
	FD lists and FD management code.  

2000-11-08 02:34  adrian

	* include/fdlist.h, include/s_bsd.h, src/fdlist.c, src/listener.c,
	src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c,
	src/s_serv.c, src/send.c: 
	
	Initial non-optimised version of my fd list code.  
	
	The idea is that for the most part, we can detect busy and idle
	clients at IO register time (and, at the outside, we can re-decide
	when we get a ping back from a client..) 
	
	The FD list is passed through comm_setselect() as its second
	argument.  There will be some weirdnesses where FDs shift lists
	frequently, but I will play with this code soon.  
	
	Read include/fdlist.h for the list of FD lists.  

2000-11-08 01:53  adrian

	* doc/technical/event.txt: 
	
	Added initial documentation for the event code.  

2000-11-07 20:55  ryan

	* Hybrid-team: 
	
	added myself. oops :) 

2000-11-07 11:10  adrian

	* doc/technical/network.txt: 
	
	A network code overview. Very brief (only comm_setselect() is
	covered right now), but I'll be adding to it real soon.  

2000-11-07 10:07  ejb

	* include/config.h.dist, include/handlers.h, include/msg.h,
	src/parse.c: added support for /undline and /ungline (ported from
	toot's patch to -6) 

2000-11-06 20:51  db

	* include/handlers.h: 
	- rewrote m_privmsg.c more or less completely.  
	  Still TODO re-add the additional privileged things opers get 
	  copy this code in m_notice.c 
	  TEST TEST TEST I think it works...  

2000-11-06 15:24  db

	* include/client.h: 
	- split m_sjoin.c up a bit more, added vchan support for remote
	  clients I want to revisit this code. The problem is, remote servers
	  can have more allocated channels per user, and we have a fixed sized
	  vchan map ;-( So, whats fine locally may be too small for a remote
	  user. Perhaps the vchan map should be a link list? or we suffer with
	  scanning all vchans for remote clients? 
	
	- moved vchan map into all clients even remote, section. blech. read 
	  comments above.  
	
	- cleaned up m_cjoin a bit 

2000-11-06 15:23  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	We don't need to flush a socket buffer when we've already done it.  
	REJECT_HOLD is fun code .. and yes, it was my screwup.  

2000-11-06 15:15  adrian

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	
	use autoconf'ed CFLAGS, rather than enforcing inheriting it from the 
	top level Makefile. This allows 'make' in src/ work *properly*.  

2000-11-06 14:51  adrian

	* src/s_auth.c: 
	
	Only add a client to the AuthClientList if we're doing iauth.  

2000-11-06 11:57  db

	* src/vchannel.c: 
	- don't list secret channels in vchan ! list 

2000-11-06 09:11  adrian

	* Makefile.in, configure, include/client.h, include/config.h,
	include/config.h.dist, include/m_info.h, include/msg.h,
	include/s_conf.h, include/s_serv.h, src/Makefile.in, src/client.c,
	src/ircd.c, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, src/packet.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c,
	src/s_bsd_select.c, src/s_conf.c, src/s_serv.c, src/send.c: 
	
	I hate doing it, but here it is. One blind commit to rip out
	ziplinks from hybrid-7, as they will be re-implemented later on as
	an external process rather than be in the code.  
	
	the actual zip files haven't been removed, since I'm probably going
	to reuse them very soon now.  
	
	This hasn't been tested. It compiles. I will do more testing this
	evening, and probably do some much needed tidyups to the
	client/server send and receive code.  

2000-11-06 08:49  adrian

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	
	fd limit checking is done in comm_open() now, so remove a superflous
	check.  This has the added advantage of killing an incorrect close()
	which should have been an fd_close(), but it doesn't matter much now
	..  

2000-11-06 08:40  db

	* include/handlers.h, src/channel.c, src/parse.c: 
	- reworked even more code 
	  I removed remote m_away entirely for now 
	- fixed serious botch in channel.s with channel_mode 

2000-11-06 07:58  adrian

	* src/Makefile.in: 
	
	Thanks to is- for pointing out the *correct* fix: default: <build
	target> Reverted the previous patch, and set default:    all 

2000-11-06 07:49  adrian

	* src/Makefile.in: 
	
	Rearrange the Makefile targets so 'make' in src does the right
	thing(tm).  

2000-11-06 06:48  adrian

	* include/res.h, include/s_conf.h, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/s_conf.c: 
	
	Finally kill the DNS cache code altogether from the API.
	gethost_byname() and gethost_byaddr() now are void functions, rather
	than struct DNSReply * functions. If we want to implement a DNS
	cache, we can do it later with some callback trickery without having
	to always check the result and do trickery in all the client code.
	(Which makes things hard to follow :-) 
	
	The users of gethost_ were converted to assume the callback will be
	made at some future time. Note that we can't simply call the
	callback inside gethost_ because it'd break things. (What you'd do
	is have a function called res_callbackhits() before comm_select() is
	invoked to do the DNS callbacks for any cache hits..) 

2000-11-06 01:40  db

	* include/channel.h, include/config.h, include/ircd_defs.h,
	include/m_info.h, include/s_stats.h, src/s_debug.c, src/s_stats.c: 
	- even more cleanups 
	  removed a pile of unused #ifdef's lets move these into runtime
	  config or EVEN better loadable modules. (hint is- hint hint hint) 
	
	  And oh yes, show oper passwords on failure wasn't is-'s fault. happy
	  now? 
	
	  Ok, sjoin from remote server for a vchan is going to be interesting.  
	currently our vchan map is only kept for local clients. duh.  
	find_vchan() won't work on a remote client. duh. (vhan_map) The
	question now is, do we extend vchan_map to remote clients as well 
	and fill in the map on sjoins? or figure out its a remote client and
	walk the vchan link list instead for remote clients? *sigh* The map
	is definitely faster for local clients, as it is filled in in m_join
	and m_part etc....  Actually, the idea of caching them as found for
	remote clients sounds like the best compromise...  

2000-11-06 01:13  db

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/hash.c: 
	- removed prototype that no longer existed 
	- fixed comment in hash.c 
	- reworked yet another inconsistent function 

2000-11-05 23:56  db

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/list.c,
	src/s_user.c: 
	- made some functions consistent in use... i.e. always start with
	chptr 
	- removed some dead functions 
	- removed del_invite add_invite from channel.c moved to m_invite.c 
	
	  I think I got this right. There were functions that had chptr first,
	then others that had sptr first.. inconsistent...  
	
	  Removed a few no longer used or defined functions. duh 

2000-11-05 20:28  ryan

	* tools/rsa_respond/: Makefile, README: 
	
	Added $Id$ tags to rsa_respond (oops) 

2000-11-05 18:33  ryan

	* tools/rsa_respond/: Makefile, README: 
	
	This is the example client implimentation of RSA authentication for
	opers 

2000-11-05 14:23  toot

	* include/channel.h, include/client.h, include/handlers.h,
	src/parse.c: David-T's patch that add vchan support to KNOCK, and
	fixes the flood control 

2000-11-05 11:56  db

	* include/s_conf.h: 
	- clean ups to m_join.c 
	- resolved conflict in s_conf.h 

2000-11-05 09:33  adrian

	* Hybrid-team, src/s_auth.c, src/version.c.SH: 
	
	Tidyups of src/s_auth.c .  
	
	Submitted by: David Taylor <davidt@yadt.co.uk> 

2000-11-05 08:51  adrian

	* include/s_conf.h: 
	
	Kill #ifdef IDLE_CHECK, since someone did it in mtrie.conf ..  

2000-11-05 08:24  db

	* src/: channel.c, ircd.c, s_user.c: 
	- redid m_join.c its still evil, but not quite as bad 

2000-11-05 01:15  db

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- removed a bunch of stuff. JUPE_CHANNEL is gone 
	  Its really not needed with vchans 
	- removed more SPLIT_MODE cruft, also not needed 

2000-11-05 00:51  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y: 
	- fixed stupid in m_oper.c, it wouldn't have honoured O from other
	servers..  
	
	- removed show oper password on fail... The reason is nasty.. When 
	  Europeans got hackered recently, irc.hemmet etc.... The kiddies
	  were opered up with hacked O lines.. A few opers accidentally used
	  the O line passwords for other servers on the hacked server...
	  showing the kiddies their O line passwords for yet more servers...
	  This is a bad idea completely. *sigh* Yes, maybe it should be up to
	  the admins, but it is just a bad idea I think. Sorry is- 

2000-11-04 23:23  db

	* include/client.h, include/handlers.h, src/parse.c: 
	- slight cleanups to m_part.c 
	- added vchan support to m_whois.c m_who.c 
	- added fughly hack to parse... more than one unregistered message 
	  results it no more unregistered messages...  

2000-11-04 20:37  ryan

	* include/client.h, include/handlers.h, include/msg.h,
	include/numeric.h, include/rsa.h, src/Makefile.in,
	src/messages.tab, src/parse.c: 
	
	RSA implimented.  /quote CHALLENGE (with --enable-openssl) now we
	just need some clever way to make /oper accept the response :) 

2000-11-04 20:01  db

	* doc/vchans.txt: 
	- added vchans.txt doc 

2000-11-04 18:53  db

	* include/handlers.h, src/parse.c: 
	- cleaned up m_nick.c a bit. ms_nick still needs a lot more work 
	  but at least its not doggie doo-doo any more. ms_nick is still too
	  long.  The fd_note function looks expensive to use in
	production... adrian? 

2000-11-04 18:28  ryan

	* src/: Makefile.in, rsa.c: 
	
	Added initial RSA support (challenge/response stuff) nothing is
	actually built without specifying --enable-openssl (which results in
	rsa.c compiling and the ircd being linked with -lcrypto) 

2000-11-04 15:58  ryan

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, src/Makefile.in: 
	
	Modified configure.in and regenerated ./configure, Modified
	Makefile.in in preperation for optional openssl support (for RSA
	authentication of opers) 

2000-11-04 10:44  adrian

	* include/fdlist.h, src/fdlist.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	
	
	* add fd_note() which changes the FD description 
	* add fd_dump() which dumps the current opened FD list to the given 
	  client 
	* add /stats F / /stats f support from opers to dump the current 
	  open sockets. This could do with more info being dumped, but its
	  fun for debugging right now.  
	* add Server: and Nick: in front of the server and nick connections 
	  so /stats F looks useful 
	* .. and finally, use fd_note() in src/m_nick.c to set the nickname 
	  description whenever the client sets its nick.  
	
	IsLocal() isn't functional. Grr.  

2000-11-04 05:17  adrian

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/listener.c, src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	
	* set the socket to non-blocking in comm_open(), and fail the socket 
	  creation if this fails. All network sockets should be non-blocking 
	  in this ircd! 
	
	* add comm_accept() - a mirror of accept() but enforcing
	  non-blockingness and FD limits also 
	
	* modify listener.c to use comm_accept() instead of accept() and
	fd_open() .  

2000-11-03 15:35  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	with REJECT_HOLD, we read() from the fd to flush the buffer, instead
	of ignoring it. This is event-IO friendly, and it will stop
	triggering unwanted read IO events.  

2000-11-03 15:17  adrian

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/ircdauth.c, src/listener.c, src/s_auth.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	
	Implementing comm_open(). This is designed to be a socket() and 
	fd_open() wrapper which limits the number of possible open FDs to 
	MASTER_MAX (for the time being - better suggestions please :) 
	
	So now, you should be either using file_open() / fbopen(), or 
	comm_open(), and *NOT* any other calls if you can avoid it.  I
	haven't wrapped dup/dup2/pipe, since the ircd currently does not use
	them.  

2000-11-03 13:35  adrian

	* include/fdlist.h, include/s_bsd.h, src/fdlist.c, src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	
	* move highest_fd into fdlist.h and out of s_bsd.h for the time 
	  being 
	* add a number_fd variable giving us the number of file descriptors 
	  currently open. This will become useful for limiting socket
	  creation and so forth when we're trying to avoid over-flowing the
	  number of file descriptors open ..  

2000-11-03 11:54  adrian

	* include/fdlist.h, src/client.c, src/fdlist.c, src/s_auth.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c: 
	
	Kill fdlist_add and fdlist_delete, since we're not using them
	anymore.  

2000-11-03 11:20  adrian

	* src/: s_bsd_kqueue.c, s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	local[] is already defined in s_bsd.c, so there is no reason to have 
	it defined in the poll and kqueue modules.  

2000-11-03 02:43  adrian

	* src/ircd.c: 
	
	Call init_netio() earlier than anything which could call
	comm_setselect(). This is why the resolver wasn't working with
	kqueue, because we didn't have the kqueue fd open at the time the
	resolver fd was comm_setselect()ed .  

2000-11-03 01:26  adrian

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	
	Tidy up the logging during a connection attempt - print a connect
	message *before* calling serv_connect(), because it can generate an
	error itself, sending the error to the client *before* sending the
	activated line.  (This is a side-effect of callbacks, btw. We could
	get around it, but this just seems clearer to me.) 

2000-11-02 22:04  db

	* src/s_debug.c: 
	- reworked m_names.c 
	- added fix by rodder from hybrid-6 for log botch 

2000-11-02 15:07  adrian

	* configure, autoconf/configure.in, src/s_bsd_kqueue.c: 
	
	Add in the initial kqueue implementation. Note that DNS breaks under
	anything before 4.1-REL because of a bug in kqueue() (if I remember
	right).  
	
	This code is very simple, and has no debugging. I'll be (ab)using it 
	in about a week after I've tidied up some other bits of code, but I
	thought I'd give you guys something to play with. :) 

2000-11-02 14:46  adrian

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	
	tidy up the code in serv_connect(), which basically is some
	formatting changes and a comment change to reflect a function name
	change.  

2000-11-02 14:37  adrian

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	
	when serv_connect_callback() isn't COMM_OK: 
	
	Log to opers the actual error, rather than it going as a wallop or 
	something. This makes it appear with the connect messages to opers, 
	which IMHO is where it *should* be going.  

2000-11-02 14:31  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	Fix the timeout code so its added when we do a non-DNS connect(),
	and cleared when we call the callback so it doesn't trigger wrongly.  

2000-11-02 12:42  bill

	* Makefile.in: 
	
	iauth/ was missed in SUBDIRS 

2000-11-02 12:18  adrian

	* src/fdlist.c: 
	
	.. oops, forgot an #include for close() .  

2000-11-02 12:05  adrian

	* include/send.h, src/s_bsd.c, src/send.c: 
	
	
	* convert send_queued_write() to a global so we can use it in other
	places ..  
	* .. like close_connection(), to flush data before the socket closes 
	
	This now means peopl get their quit messages back before the FD
	closes! :P 

2000-11-02 11:30  adrian

	* src/fdlist.c: 
	
	fd_close() is meant to close() the fd, rather than squid's which
	doesn't (this is because its got more sane file_open/close and
	comm_open/close code ..) 
	
	This fixes the fd leak and non-closing fd problems.  

2000-11-02 11:22  adrian

	* include/s_bsd.h, include/s_serv.h, src/ircd.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/s_bsd_poll.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	
	Initial change over of the server connect() code to use the new
	world order(tm).  
	
	* Fix a couple of stupidities in my last commit of comm_strerror 
	* Strip the server connection stuff out of s_bsd.c and move it into 
	  two functions in s_serv.c - 
	  + serv_connect() - initiate a connection to a server (replacing 
	    connect_server() 
	  + serv_connect_callback() - completion from comm_connect_tcp() 
	
	Note that there doesn't seem to be checking to see if a /connect
	server is actually in the process of being connect'ed. This should
	happen! 
	
	The code works and connects to the server(s) on startup, but /squit
	and /connect's fail. I've found that clients that /quit dont have
	their sockets closed .. I have to figure that out, which might solve
	this.  

2000-11-02 08:09  toot

	* include/vchannel.h, src/vchannel.c: . fixed a possible over flow
	when listing available vchans . have it show the nickname of who's
	been there longest 

2000-11-02 07:52  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c, include/fdlist.h: 
	
	Add a routine to output string versions of the COMM_ status 

2000-11-02 07:29  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	oops, forgot to return; after the COMM_ERR_BIND, which meant it
	still tried to connect..  

2000-11-01 12:13  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	.. and remember that a retried connect() can return EISCONN which 
	means the socket is already connect()ed, and its not actually an 
	error.  
	
	This makes the auth code work again. Yay. :) 

2000-11-01 11:53  adrian

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Converting the ident auth code over to use comm_connect_tcp().  Note
	that this code doesn't entirely work yet, but it doesn't NOT work 
	(go on, parse that) 
	
	* rip the bind() / connect() code out of s_auth.c and use 
	  comm_connect_tcp() instead 
	
	* change send_auth_query() into a CNCB - it is called once 
	  comm_connect_tcp() completes in order, and handles errors from 
	  it before attempting to write to the socket.  
	
	* fix comm_connect_tcp() to actually work ! : 
	  + actually *remember* to record the port 
	  + don't do DNS lookups on IPs when you want an IP, instead attempt
	    to convert it to a in_addr, and if it fails try to look it up with 
	    gethost_byname() 
	
	* Remove all the auth descriptor stuff from send_message(), leaving
	  only server connect()s 

2000-11-01 09:22  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c, include/s_bsd.h: 
	
	Add a 'local' parameter to comm_connect_tcp() to specify what to
	bind() to locally. Currently if NULL is passed no bind() is
	performed, but later on this will change to bind() to the virtual
	server IP if one is configured.  

2000-11-01 08:53  adrian

	* include/s_auth.h, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Make the auth read is now done through comm_setselect(), rather than 
	through read_message(). This means that all read_message() does now 
	is handle completion of auth and server connect()s, which is next to
	go.  

2000-11-01 08:28  adrian

	* include/s_auth.h, src/s_auth.c: 
	
	tidy up the auth code to use the block allocator rather than
	mymalloc/myfree 

2000-11-01 08:19  adrian

	more comm_connect() code. This again hasn't been tested.  
	
	* finished comm_connect_tryconnect() to do what it should 
	* deal with the DNS return

	* include/fdlist.h, src/fdlist.c, src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	Add some more code to implement comm_connect_tcp(). Its not
	functional yet, but its getting there.  

2000-10-31 07:27  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	A temporary hack to make sure we're reading data once a server 
	connection has completed. It will go away when I finish this 
	replacement comm_connect_tcp() code.  
	
	Server connections *should* work now. They seem to work for me :) 

2000-10-31 07:21  adrian

	* src/: fdlist.c, ircd.c: 
	
	Whatever the crack was that convinced me calling eventAdd() from
	somewhere *before* eventInit() was called, never ever come close to
	me again.  

2000-10-31 06:21  adrian

	* include/fdlist.h, include/s_bsd.h, src/fdlist.c, src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	Initial timeout fd stuff. There is no code that uses it yet, but its
	there and running for when I (am about to) do.  
	
	The idea is that you register a callback to be called after a given
	time period has elapsed. This is good for things like checking ping
	returns, where you set the timeout period on the fd to be 2*ping,
	and when you get a PONG you reset the timeout period. If the socket
	ever times out, you get a ping timeout.  
	
	Its also going to be used for the up-coming non-blocking connect()
	code, where a socket timeout kicks in to prevent a connect() taking
	too long to run.  
	
	Once check_pings() has been split up, this and the poll/select/etc
	loop should be the only two places that walking the entire
	fd_table[] array is allowed.  

2000-10-31 04:20  adrian

	* src/s_auth.c: 
	
	We should be registering a COMM_SELECT_READ, not WRITE.  The only
	reason this was working was because the socket was ready for writing
	also at the correct time it was ready for reading ..  uhm, sad. :-) 

2000-10-30 16:11  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	Eek, don't re-register a read if cptr->fd == -1, ie she's shutting
	down.  

2000-10-30 16:03  adrian

	* include/m_info.h, src/fdlist.c, src/ircd.c: 
	
	
	* kill the priority code 
	* kill the burst mode code (there are still bits and pieces of the
	  variables somewhere still.. :) 
	* call read_message() with a delay of 0, and call comm_select() with
	  delay rather than 1. This makes the ircd snappier again ..  

2000-10-30 15:43  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	kill npollfds and use highest_fd in its place, which is just as
	good.  

2000-10-30 15:32  adrian

	* include/s_bsd.h, src/s_auth.c, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Optimise the read code. When a connection graduates from the auth
	state and is upgraded to a client, its added via comm_setselect() to
	start reading data.  
	
	* read_packet() has been turned into a PF, so it can be called when
	  a FD is ready for reading.  
	
	* read_packet() has been stripped quite a bit - we *assume* that
	  there will be data returned from the read. If not, thats a socket
	error 
	
	* error handling has been moved into read_packet() instead of its
	  return value 
	
	* note that the data is put into the dbuf as fast as possible,
	  rather than being evil and waiting. I'll fix the DoSability of this
	  code at a later date, and without ignoring reads. :-P

	* include/s_bsd.h, include/send.h, src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c,
	src/send.c: 
	
	Big big write optimisation, taking client and server writes into the 
	new network loop: 
	
	* flush_sendq_except() is gone. This was called when data was 
	  added to a dbuf and a new one needed allocating, probably to 
	  increase network throughput and decrease dbuf usage. It should 
	  not be needed now.  
	
	* send_queued() has been turned into send_queued_write() which is 
	  an IO callback now.  
	
	* send_message() will now *always* schedule a COMM_SELECT_WRITE 
	  regardless of how small the sendq is. This should up the 
	  network throughput and reduce the CPU a little.  
	
	* send_queued_write() should be rescheduling a COMM_SELECT_WRITE 
	  if the dbuf chain hasn't been drained fully. I'm still 
	  researching this to make sure the variable 'more' is set in 
	  the right places.  
	
	* fd shutdown code in s_bsd.c called send_queued() to flush dbufs 
	  before killing the FD. This obviously can't be done now.  
	  As noted in a comment, when close handlers are implemented 
	  correctly, the dbuf will be flushed (or attempted to) before 
	  the FD closes totally, so we just ignore it here for now.  
	
	* Make the old-style poll code not register and check write 
	  events for FDs that need data written. So now, the only 
	  thing that can trigger a client/server FD write in the old-style 
	  poll code is the completion of a connect(). All server/client 
	  FD writes are done through comm_select() in the new world order.  
	
	send_message() could probably attempt to call send_queued_write() 
	rather than waiting for the fd to be ready for writing, but this is
	an optimisation for another time. (And easy too, since the original
	code for send_message() called send_queued() anyway, so there
	shouldn't be any problems there .. :) 

2000-10-30 01:22  db

	  both handlers call do_normal_stats

	  I think it belongs there since /stats z is memory report 
	  I'd eventually like to have oper only /stats such as 
	  /stats events, /stats memory , /stats memory klines 
	  This could lend itself well to gersh's new malloc memory reporting

	* include/client.h, include/ircd.h, src/client.c, src/ircd.c: 
	
	move check_pings() into an event, and tidy up a random comment.  
	check_pings() is now called once a second to make sure we catch all 
	pings that should be pong'ed, since nextping isn't reset anywhere in
	the code anymore. This isn't entirely optimal, but it will do until
	I've tidied up the rest of the network code. When this is done, I'll
	optimise check_pings() so it doesn't have to do so much work to
	decide whether a client/server should have responded.

	- split check_pings into two (like it should have been all along) 
	  check_pings checks for ping timeouts 
	  check_kline checks for klines 
	  both call common exit routine 
	  m_kline has to call check_kline after placing a kline. It would be 
	  better if it was put on the nice event queue incase a tcm or oper 
	  places several klines in a row. But then, opers freak when a kline 
	  doesn't happen instantly.

	* src/: fdlist.c, s_bsd.c: 
	
	tidy up the highest_fd handling. Now, the handling is done through 
	fd_open() / fd_close(), reducing the number of places tracking is 
	done.  

2000-10-25 03:00  adrian

	* include/listener.h, src/listener.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Move the listener code to use comm_setselect().  
	
	* accept_connection() has changed to become a PF function for use 
	  with comm_setselect() 
	* When a listener is created, comm_setselect() is called to make 
	  the initial IO on the FD work 
	* reworked read_message() in s_bsd_poll.c to deal with no listen
	sockets 
	
	All read_message() does now (!) is handle auth and client/server
	sockets.  Here's an excerpt from the code explaining the major real
	change that happened: 
	
	   * Since we're going to rip this code out anyway, the current "hack" 
	   * will suffice to keep things going. The only two things this
	   loop 
	* services now is the auth and client/server fds (resolver and 
	   * listener FDs are done through the new-style interface) . So, 
	   * we loop again through the poll_fdarray[] array from scratch
	   again 
	* and fd's that are not -1 are ready for us to do read-type events 
	   * with. The pollfd_array[i].fd = -1; in the auth fd loop stops us 
	   * from looking at the auth fds as client/server fds which would
	   be 
	* a Bad Thing(tm) right now. :-)    -- adrian 
	
	* We have to recheck the incoming connection code to ratelimit the
	  number of incoming connections/sec to stop connection flooders. Uhm,
	  there was some code in read_message() from comstud to do this, I'll
	  move it out into accept_connection() once read_message() has gone
	away.  

2000-10-25 00:36  adrian

	* src/s_bsd.c: 
	
	Just set the nonblocking flag when we set a socket non-blocking ..  

2000-10-25 00:07  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Use the pre-munged poll flags for network IO, rather than creating 
	our own set of POLL* flags.  

2000-10-24 23:06  db

	* include/: config.h, ircd.h: 
	- removed NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT 
	- cleaned up m_join.c a bit

2000-10-24 17:04  adrian

	* include/res.h, src/client.c, src/ircd.c, src/s_bsd.c,
	src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Commit the tidyup of the resolver network code (notice I said
	*network* :) --> 
	
	* move init_resolver() to a more useful init place and out of
	init_netio() 
	* make the DNS timeout checking an event which is triggered once a
	  second.  I figure that when I rewrite the event system soon to work
	  on milliseconds rather than seconds we might revisit this, but doing
	  it once a second actually might be better. Dunno yet..  
	* add comm_setselect() calls in the resolver init and just after the 
	  recvfrom() to re-register interest in IO.  
	* remove the evilness in read_message() which does the IO on 
	  ResolverFileDescriptor, making resolver IO happen through the new
	  network IO system 
	
	Notes: 
	
	* I have *NO* idea how the DNS write flushing works just yet, I
	  guess I'm about to find out.  
	
	* The resolver might take a little longer - this is simply the
	  by-product of shoehorning in the comm_select() call (if there is no
	  other pending IO, read_message() can delay for a bit, since the
	  resolver fd isn't covered there.) Once read_message() disappears, so
	  will the delays.  (or I might just fix it somehow..) 

2000-10-24 16:53  adrian

	* src/ircd.c: 
	
	Remember to initialise the event subsystem early so we can use it.  

2000-10-24 16:42  adrian

	* src/s_bsd_poll.c: 
	
	Arrays start at 0, not 1 in C. When we find out the lowest numbered
	fd, we need to make sure npollfds is one more than that value,
	otherwise the last filedescriptor won't get polled.

	Commit the fd state tidyup and new IO loop code.  
	
	* I've killed GlobalFDList and replaced it with an array of fd
	  structs.  
	(fde_t). This has the fd state (opened, closed, pending io requests, 
	  type, description, etc).  
	* I've added fd state tracking stuff (fd_open / fd_close).  
	* I've added file fd state tracking stuff (file_open / file_close) 
	* I've tidied up logfile permissions in a place or two 
	
	There's a little weirdness - if you want to include s_bsd.h, you
	need to include fdlist.h as well. This will go away eventually ..  

2000-10-23 11:44  db

	* src/s_bsd_select.c: 
	- modified cjoin to use the ##channel_name as given in original spec

	- duplicated voodoo code into mo_join.. in m_join.c 
	  handlers still need a lot of cleanup due to the duplicated code...  

2000-10-23 09:42  toot

	* src/channel.c: fixed channel.c/remove_empty_channels() so it
	compiled with PRESERVE_CHANNELS #defined 

2000-10-23 08:10  adrian

	* include/event.h, src/Makefile.in, src/event.c, src/ircd.c: 
	
	Added a port of squid's event system. This is a very simple
	mechanism to schedule events to happen in some given time period.
	The main function you'll be using is: 
	
	eventAdd(const char *text, EVH *func, void *data, time_t when, int
	weight) 
	
	where when is the number of seconds you want to have the event run
	(so if you want it running a second from now, you'd set when to be
	1.) 
	
	Read event.c for a more precise description.  
	
	What has changed: 
	
	* changed this over to use the Block allocator rather than squid's
	mempools 
	* disabled debug reporting until I figure out a nice way (ie how the
	  rest of the ircd does it) of doing this 
	* made the time offsets integer, rather than double like they are in
	squid 
	* the logic in io_loop() has been changed to allow this to slide in.  
	
	Note that eventAddIsh()'s logic on random offsets might be a bit ..
	off.  I'll come back to this once I've tidied up bits of the code.  
	
	I will also be tidying up io_loop() now an event scheduling
	mechanism exists, making it much, much less twisted. So any breaks
	there will 
	(hopefully) be temporary.  

2000-10-23 05:37  adrian

	* configure, autoconf/acconfig.h, autoconf/configure.in,
	include/s_bsd.h, include/setup.h.in, src/Makefile.in, src/ircd.c,
	src/s_bsd.c, src/s_bsd_poll.c, src/s_bsd_select.c: 
	
	
	
	
	
	first split of the network code into per-commloop modules. The
	autoconf magic came from the squid commloops work by Adrian Chadd
	(me) and Benno Rice (benno@holocaine.net).  
	
	the poll and select specific stuff was moved into s_bsd_poll.c and 
	s_bsd_select.c . The chosen file is done through some autoconf magic 
	and variable substitution in src/Makefile.in. I haven't changed any 
	code itself, simply un-staticized things and shifted things into 
	seperate files. This is done to preserve some form of CVS sanity.  
	
	A noteable here is that I"ve moved the FD_SETSIZE detection for 
	select() into s_bsd_select.c rather than ircd.c, since this is a
	more logical place to check (and die) if FD_SETSIZE <
	MAXCONNECTIONS.  
	
	The autoconf configuration is done using the following options to 
	configure: 
	
	--enable-poll / --disable-poll : Enable or disable the use of poll() 
	--enable-select / --disable-select : ENable or disable the use of
	select() 
	
	Note that the current autoconf magic checks if poll() exists - since 
	we aren't using USE_POLL now, we define
	ac_cv_func_poll/select/whatever and this is used further into the
	autoconf magic to decide the substitutions to do.

	* src/channel.c: . renamed free_bans_exceptions_denies to
	  free_channel_masks, and had it free invite exceptions too.  .
	remove_empty_channels() wasn't freeing +d (or +I) 

2000-10-21 10:27  bill

	* include/config.h: 
	
	/usr/local/ircd/ IS the default, not /usr/ejb/whatever 

2000-10-21 10:10  lusky

	* include/config.h: put DPATH and SPATH back to defaults 

2000-10-21 09:55  bill

	* include/config.h, src/channel.c: 
	
	fixed bug in MODE (MODE #non-existant-chan caused segfault) made
	attempted JOIN to a juped channel specify between user or oper 

2000-10-21 00:15  lusky

	* include/ircd.h, src/s_user.c, src/version.c.SH: fix for duplicate
	401's for kick #validchan invalnick ServerStats->is_ref is
	  incremented twice on an X-line which is set to 1 (jdc) STATS P
	notifications were not sent to opers (jdc) stats l/L target to
	FLAGS_SPY (if STATS_NOTICE) (jdc) uname info only displayed to opers 
	If X-line port field is 2, reject client but do not send 
	  a notification to opers STATS y/Y now oper-only did NOT add any of
	  the other conf line display restrictions, I think we should
	  integrate control of those on a per-line basis in the new conf
	format.  

2000-10-20 08:29  toot

	* src/parse.c: msg nick with no text made it core..  privmsg/notice
	give different errors depending what args are missing, so they check
	it instead of parse() 

2000-10-16 23:37  lusky

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_serv.c: fixed a bug tickled by sending
	a bogus SERVER command from hacked server auditted leakage of IP
	address from get_client_name calls 

2000-10-16 16:17  toot

	* src/channel.c: now it will remove the basechan when there's no
	vchans left under it 

2000-10-16 15:54  toot

	* include/vchannel.h, src/channel.c, src/vchannel.c: . this should
	remove the basechan after deleting its last vchan, but didn't .
	  don't bother to show possible vchans if they're already in one of
	them.  . there's one case where the root is empty, and there's only
	  one vchan.. just have them join that vchan.  . displays the last
	nick to join each vchannel for now, and won't show empty vchans 

2000-10-16 10:02  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: map_vchan checks root channel too 

2000-10-16 09:23  db

	* include/vchannel.h, src/vchannel.c: 
	- semi fixed whois 

2000-10-16 09:10  toot

	* include/vchannel.h, src/vchannel.c: . don't allow JOIN to a
	'real' subchan name . some extra brackets in privmsg/notice to kill
	a compile warning . mpw JOIN #chan !nick will work on any nick in
	  the channel, just need to update show_vchans 

2000-10-15 23:44  db

	* src/vchannel.c: 
	- fixed stupid bug with vchan == chptr i.e. top level chptr == vchan 
	  that would result in it never being removed, since vchan == chptr
	  (top chan) would never result in a match ... this led to rework of
	privmsg to channel 
	
	- kick appears to work now on vchan 

2000-10-15 13:59  db

	* include/channel.h, src/channel.c: 
	- the m_mode changes needed 
	  this allows you to mode +o etc. on sub chans. wheeeeeee 

2000-10-15 10:51  db

	* include/channel.h: 
	- slightly rewrote m_names. its still a stinking mess but getting
	there 
	- added function call to make vchan names listing easier 

2000-10-15 06:42  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: some more fixes to join/cjoin 

2000-10-14 15:42  toot

	* src/channel.c: . move add_vchan_to_client lower down, incase of
	bans etc in m_join . hopefully m_names works now after /join #chan
	!id . put a del_vchan_from_client in remove_user_from_channel 

2000-10-14 15:07  db

	* include/vchannel.h, src/vchannel.c: 
	- fixed bug in add_vchan_to_client_cache, reversed two args while at
	it 
	- made m_privmsg message right channel 
	- m_join also has to update cache 

2000-10-14 14:10  db

	* include/vchannel.h, src/vchannel.c: 
	- added code to remove chan from client cache, not used yet 
	- added checks to ensure client doesn't join twice a subchan, not
	tested yet 
	- corrected conflict introduced by me 
	- added another macro for top level vchan detect 

2000-10-14 13:54  toot

	* include/numeric.h, src/messages.tab, src/s_user.c: . fixed typo
	in s_user.c . made RPL_WHOISADMIN numeric consistent with dalnet .
	changed a ->flags pointer that should have been ->umodes in m_whois 

2000-10-14 10:15  toot

	* src/vchannel.c: . don't allow CJOIN to a non-base channel . don't
	  list sub-channels if they try to /join a sub-channel's 'long' name .
	  added an extra arg to m_names so it works after a CJOIN (there might
	be a better way to do this) 

2000-10-14 07:26  db

	* include/vchannel.h, src/vchannel.c: 
	- moved show_vchans and find_vchan into vchannel.c

	- folded in work toot (Toby Verrall) to7@antipope.fsnet.co.uk 
	  did for first rough proof of concept vchans. We'll have to go in
	  and #ifdef these later.  

2000-10-11 20:29  lusky

	* src/channel.c: fix for *@*.foo.com I:lines being broken by a
	user@host.foo.com I:lines change chptr->vchans to chptr->vchan_flag

	changes i made over the weekend.  
	- add n!u@h for topic_info ala ircnet.  
	- stats p notice.  
	- removed some old non-TS cruft.  
	- unreg users can't send version.  
	- added +a umode, shows oper is admin in whois 
	  if they are 'admin=yes'.  
	- users can see the topic of a -s channel they aren't 
	  on (but can't set it even if it is -t, to prevent 
	  topic floods *sigh*) 
	- many changes in parse.c .. fixed a few bugs, rewrote 
	  the argument parser code, added support for catching 
	  users passing not enough parms before the m_ function 
	  is even called.  
	- you can now set in ircd.conf whether channels have to 
	  be +i for an invite to work.  
	- added a numeric (504) for sending to users trying to 
	  invite remote users to +i channels.  
	- started changing m_* functions to not check parc anymore, 
	  in most cases parse() has already handled this.  
	- move glines from config.h to ircd.conf plus a lot of other stuff i
	probably forgot.

	- committing some quick hacks for verifying block allocator 
	  is not leaking.  
	  These should be #ifdef'ed perhaps in future.  
	  when an oper does /stats $ 
	  four files will be written to DPATH

	  local_block_allocator_client_list.txt from block allocator

2000-01-16 15:27  db

	* include/class.h: 
	- prelim. change before I start on class names 

2000-01-16 15:24  db

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y: 
	- oper section complete except for class operations..  

2000-01-16 15:16  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y,
	src/s_conf.c: 
	- checkpoint with operator section mostly working...  
	  class code has to be rewritten still 

2000-01-16 09:20  db

	* src/Makefile.in: 
	- oops. I changed Makefile rather than Makefile.in 

2000-01-16 09:19  db

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y, s_conf.c: 
	- copyright touch ups 
	- missing -ll in Makefile 

2000-01-15 21:46  db

	* src/: ircd_lexer.l, ircd_parser.y: 
	- The lex/yacc files...  

2000-01-15 21:35  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/Makefile.in, src/s_conf.c: 
	- first very rough working lex/yacc under ircd-hybrid..  
	  parser doesn't actually do anything.... yet...  
	  Tom, we could use a fileio pushback, to push back a line thats 
	  "not for us" 

2000-01-15 15:46  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/s_conf.c: 
	- more cleanups to parse code 

2000-01-13 18:16  db

	* include/s_conf.h, src/Makefile.in, src/s_conf.c, src/send.c: 
	- externalized the old parser, unfortunately, this means a lot 
	  more of the s_conf interface is visible ;-(, can do better in the
	  future...  This is in preparation for new parser inclusion.  
	  This will (ick) allow us to use both old conf files and new format
	  conf files for backwards compatibility. (I'm not terribly happy
	  about this, but...  Hi Tom!) 

2000-01-12 20:02  db

	* src/s_conf.c, tools/convertconf.c: 
	- returned to ';' at end of each section, this is actually easier to 
	  recover from errors; just scan for ';' 
	- updated convertconf to produce test file 
	- added IP token to lexer and to client section 

2000-01-11 21:05  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- added DENY 

2000-01-11 20:56  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- more work on yacc/lex parser 
	  added "kill" open to discussion, but efnet has "K" and "D" lines 

2000-01-11 20:39  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- changes to bring it into line with Kev's sample conf just a tiny
	bit 
	- removed that dumb ';' at end of sections 

2000-01-11 20:09  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- oops port in connect was quoted 

2000-01-11 20:08  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- more tiny tweaks 

2000-01-11 19:34  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- tweaks to new conf format 

2000-01-11 18:31  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- sample ircd.conf and its converted ircd.conf.new 

2000-01-11 15:55  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- Now pretty much handles a "normal" conf file.. output is 
	  a "new" style conf format file, with details still to be hashed
	  out.  Do we want to handle multiple C/N's ? multiple H lines?
	  *sigh* yes Thats next, but not yet.  

2000-01-10 21:02  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- tiny tweak much more to do 

2000-01-10 20:08  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- Nearly done. TODO Finish off I lines (I line prefixes) 
	  HUB or LEAF control set in old M line 

2000-01-10 17:17  db

	* tools/: Makefile.in, convertconf.c: 
	- updated Makefile, fleshed out convertconf more 

2000-01-10 16:20  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- small cleanup to s_conf.c before the bigger one 

2000-01-09 20:21  wnder

	* doc/technical/iauth.txt: woopsies 

2000-01-09 20:19  wnder

	* doc/technical/iauth.txt: Added documentation of the iauth
	protocol 

2000-01-09 20:08  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- bit more fleshing out of convertconf.c 

2000-01-09 19:41  db

	* tools/convertconf.c: 
	- first rough outline of conversion program to convert old style 
	  to new style conf file format. No Makefile, incomplete still.  

2000-01-09 12:54  db

	* include/msg.h, src/Makefile.in: 
	- split m_privmsg and m_notice into two files. My rationale for
	  doing this is: slightly faster, no more if(notice) in code,
	  m_privmsg/m_notice rarely change anyway.  

2000-01-09 12:49  wnder

	* iauth/source/mtree.c: Added support for when SerialNumber rolls
	over to 0 

2000-01-09 12:28  db

	* iauth/source/mtree.c, src/s_conf.c: 
	- as fbgets is re-entrant, redid .include code. Much nicer 

2000-01-08 22:59  wnder

	* iauth/: include/mtree.h, source/mtree.c: Implemented serial
	number method to keep track of searched nodes.  (hi diane!!) 

2000-01-08 21:52  db

	* include/config.h, src/ircd.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- LazyLinks /list on leaf is sent to its uplink now 
	- still bug to track down with leaf connected to hub, hub joins net 
	  leaf does not see channel bursts properly 

2000-01-08 14:38  wnder

	* iauth/: Makefile.in, include/iauth.h, include/mtree.h,
	source/auth.c, source/conf.c, source/mtree.c, source/sock.c: 
	Implemented unsortable I/K lines 

2000-01-07 21:25  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- sticky / key 

2000-01-07 21:22  db

	* src/send.c: 
	- don't core if chptr == NULL in sendto_match_servs() 
	  shouldn't normally ever happen, but does in LL 

2000-01-07 20:17  db

	* include/s_serv.h, src/client.c, src/s_serv.c: 
	- closer version of LazyLinks version 2 

2000-01-07 18:59  db

	* include/s_user.h, src/Makefile.in, src/s_serv.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- split out m_user.c m_nick.c, modified s_user.c s_user.h
	  Makefile.in LazyLinks is in unworkable state in this version.  

2000-01-06 19:54  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- fixed bug introduced in ReplaceQuotes, '\#' was not handled
	correctly.  

2000-01-05 21:35  db

	* include/m_info.h: 
	- yet another hidden HUB in .h 

2000-01-05 21:34  db

	* include/msg.h: 
	- removed more pesky #ifdef HUB hidden in .h files 

2000-01-05 21:32  db

	* src/: ircd.c, s_conf.c, s_serv.c: 
	- always initialize serverMask 

2000-01-05 20:31  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- HUB removed, server determines if its HUB or LEAF by looking 
	  at (Now unused) port line in M line. If its a 1, its a HUB, if 
	  its missing or anything else, its a LEAF.  
	  Can be queried from /admin 
	  Yes, its a hack for now.  

2000-01-05 20:19  db

	* include/channel.h, include/client.h, include/config.h,

	- removed HUB from config.h etc. now in a config entry 

2000-01-05 19:36  db

	* src/: channel.c, irc_string.c, s_user.c: 
	- allow single dot in user names to allow for "first.last" user name
	style 

2000-01-05 19:04  db

	* src/: Makefile.in, channel.c: 
	- split out m_drop.c m_cburst.c m_lljoin.c 

2000-01-05 18:31  db

	- further cleanups to s_conf.c 

2000-01-05 18:21  db

	- Further cleanups to s_conf.c 

2000-01-05 16:49  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- fixed missing Y line detection code which got broken in clean up 

2000-01-05 15:57  db

	* include/channel.h: 
	- cleanups to dbuf code. Try to flush connections if dbuf list is 
	  empty then try to allocate.  
	- tiny start on new channel hierarchy scheme.  

2000-01-04 17:20  wnder

	* iauth/: include/auth.h, include/class.h, include/commands.h,

	- fixed DEBUG error in s_conf.c 

2000-01-04 13:00  db

	* src/s_debug.c: 
	- also report how many malloc()'ed dbufs there were max 

2000-01-04 12:17  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- changed slightly wording in LazyLinks As Implemented doc 
	- removed more DEBUGLL debug cruft 
	- simplified m_join CBURST call 

2000-01-04 10:52  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- added "Lazy Links As Implemented in Hybrid" doc 

2000-01-04 08:56  db

	* include/channel.h, include/client.h, include/config.h,
	include/config.h.dist, include/list.h, include/m_info.h,
	src/channel.c, src/s_debug.c, src/s_user.c: 
	- removed more #ifdef's removed BAN_INFO BAN_UH 

2000-01-03 21:44  db

	* include/config.h, include/config.h.dist, include/send.h,
	src/channel.c, src/s_debug.c, src/send.c: 
	- mods to try to flush connections if dbufs are used up 

2000-01-03 18:02  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- it all works now (LL). channel cleanup etc.  

2000-01-03 17:37  db

	* src/: channel.c, client.c: 
	- this version doesn't core as often. *sigh* 
	  cleanup channels code needs to be gone over again, its stable 
	  without.  
	- removed some cruft and useless comments from client.c 

2000-01-03 09:45  db

	* include/numeric.h: 
	- *sigh* code got lost in the shuffle 
	  fix stats c so n lines show as n not N 
	  fix spacing on 333 numeric to match others 

2000-01-03 09:18  db

	* include/numeric.h: 
	- removed last vestige of TOPIC_WHO define 

2000-01-03 09:16  db

	* src/ircd.c: 
	- fixed a typo in ircd.c 

2000-01-03 00:13  db

	* include/channel.h, include/s_serv.h, src/channel.c, src/ircd.c,
	src/s_serv.c: 
	- Folded in Perly's cleanup channel code. The idea is to remove 
	  channels from the lazylinks leaf server if no local members are on
	  them and they haven't been used by anyone locally in a "while"
	  where "while" is set in s_serv.h CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME seconds.  
	  I've redone the destroy channel code. It should work, but its
	  untested.  CLEANUP_CHANNELS_TIME is set way low still for
	  debugging, its currently 30 seconds. In production it could range
	  from 15 to 60 minutes I'd guess.  

2000-01-02 19:03  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- key handling was broken in m_cburst 

2000-01-02 18:52  db

	* src/channel.c: 
	- oops got an if backwards key when NULL cores it 

2000-01-02 17:44  db

	* src/s_serv.c: 
	- try to negotiate a non LL connect if serverMask's get all used up 
	- report all serverMask's used up. That will mean a recode ;-) 

2000-01-02 17:33  db

	* src/: channel.c, s_serv.c: 
	- fixed a bug in m_join.c 
	- cleaned up LL channel key handling 
	- don't assign serverMask's to non LL servers 

2000-01-02 15:35  db

	* doc/LazyLinks.txt, src/s_serv.c: 
	- added LazyLinks.txt document outlining original Lazy Links
	  protocol its been modified for -7 
	- ensure serverMask of 0 just causes restoreUnusedServerMask to
	return 

2000-01-02 15:11  db

	* include/msg.h, src/channel.c, src/client.c, src/parse.c,
	src/s_serv.c:

	  still needs debugging/testing etc.  

2000-01-02 00:42  db

	* src/: channel.c, s_serv.c: 
	- few tidy ups in prelim LL code 

2000-01-01 23:47  db

	* include/msg.h, src/channel.c:

	- Preliminary rough cut at Lazy Links, still a lot of mopping up to
	  do 'n' in c/n's means try lazy link, 'N' means do normal.  

2000-01-01 07:33  db

2000-01-01 07:08  db

	- Preliminary cleanups on s_conf.c 

1999-12-31 18:01  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- missing NULL assignment would cause double free's and eventual 
	  core on malformed U: lines.  

1999-12-30 21:47  wnder

	* src/: ircd.c, s_bsd.c: more iauth fixups - this should finish it! 

1999-12-30 21:37  wnder

	* src/Makefile.in, src/ircdauth.c, include/s_auth.h: IAuth fixups 

1999-12-30 21:12  wnder

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, ircd.c, s_user.c: IAuth fixups 

1999-12-30 20:50  db

1999-12-30 15:32  db

	* src/: s_auth.c, s_bsd.c, s_user.c: 
	- folding back in USE_IAUTH code 

1999-12-30 13:52  db

	- changes to sendto_one_type to not send @# style of message to non 
	  CHW servers 
	- m_userhost old behaviour restored, but rewritten. Need to support 
	  up to 5 userhost requests, this fixes ircle clients which depend
	  on this behaviour.  

1999-10-22 17:49  db

	* src/channel.c:

1999-10-17 11:38  db

	* include/msg.h, src/client.c: 
	- removed (+) cruft as this was a Tanerism 

1999-10-13 23:27  tomh

	* src/s_bsd.c: Removed CONNECTFAST garbage, it was causing
	production boxes to load up on SYNs on the primary port and killing
	poll performance.  

1999-10-13 23:18  lusky

	* src/s_bsd.c: fixed m_ison to put trailing space on 303 responses 
	CONNECTFAST is always defined for USE_POLL now, was causing very
	  poor accept performance on heavily loaded non-Solaris machines using
	poll() 

1999-10-13 23:12  tomh

	* include/setup.h.in: put USE_POLL back in setup.h.in, removed

1999-10-13 21:02  lusky

1999-10-11 08:09  db

	* src/send.c: 
	  It turns out, that cptr->fd is <0 in some cases when its being
	  used, just as Q described. I was confused at first, because it
	sounded like he was saying cptr was =freed= then being used. It
	appears its still a valid pointer, but its fd has been closed...  
	
	  The ideal solution would be to make sure the cptr is removed from
	  the channel link list before the code even gets to
	sendto_common_channels() 
	
	  In any case, using an fd < 0 in this section is a BAD THING 

1999-10-09 20:15  db

	* src/s_user.c:

1999-09-25 09:53  db

1999-09-24 21:55  db

	* src/s_conf.c: 
	- yet another ->name instead of ->user this one in report_tklines 

1999-09-24 16:23  db

	* src/s_user.c: 
	- This patch corrects a case where a normal user can oper
	themselves. oops.
