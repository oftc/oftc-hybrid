This directory contains modules and patches that have been contributed
by other people, or aren't suitable for including into the 
hybrid tree.  The coding team do not officially support the contrib/ 
modules, or guarantee any of them will actually work.

Once again. WITH feeling. Not all of these modules have been thoroughly
tested! Thats why some of them are in contrib not in the main tree yet!
At least one module in contrib has been known to core servers when used.
You have been warned.

Patches
-------

The following are the patches contained in contrib.  A short description
of the patch is contained here, along with any notes.

To apply a patch, first change to the ircd-hybrid-7 root directory, 
the directory one level above contrib/.  If you have already compiled 
the ircd, run 'make clean'.  Then for example to patch 
remote-unkline.diff type:
    patch -p0 < contrib/remote-unkline.diff

You must then run 'make' and 'make install' again, and restart your ircd.
The following patches are included:

lmh.diff 	- This patch adds remote unkline support, temp dline support,
                  better temp klines, /quote xline and global user@host
		  limits.

		  Please read README.LMH for more information as this patch
		  requires different methods to be applied and adds multiple
		  config options.

disable_identd.diff - This patch adds support for disabling identd queries.
                      See README.disable_identd for more information.
