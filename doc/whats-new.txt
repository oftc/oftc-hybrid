                           ------------------------
			   What's new in Hybrid 7.1
			   ------------------------

===================
supported platforms
===================

- We now support a completely new platform, Tru64 UNIX. It now configures and
  builds right out of the box. Thanks to HP's TestDrive program for their
  public access Tru64 boxen.
- We have mostly revamped the Windows Cygwin port, mostly thanks to some awesome
  sleuth and compile work from James LaPlant.
- The IRIX port has been brought up to date. Thanks to Mark Laws for access to a
  fine Indigo2.
- The HPUX port has been retested and minor warnings have been fixed. Thanks
  Yusuf for testing.
- Other than those, the platforms we 'support' in README.FIRST are all still
  actively supported.

===================
configure and build
===================

- The configure script has been massively revamped, and all of the Makefiles
  have undergone serious spring cleaning.
- Most noticeable is that we generate make dependencies on the fly now. This
  requires you to have some sort of program that does this, which we detect;
  currently supported are X11 makedepend, mkdep, cc -xM if using Sun Workshop
  and falling back to cc -MM if none work. If your C compiler has options to
  generate make-style dependency info and you have none of the other programs,
  send a note to joshk@triplehelix.org.
- We now support an --enable-clobber option so that binaries are not moved to
  $NAME.old when making install if they already exist. This does not apply to 
  modules as a running ircd could core if the loaded modules are moved and then
  unloaded. If you forget this when configuring, use make CLOBBER=yes install;
  depending on your variety of make, this may or may not work.
- It is now possible to build the contrib modules into your statically linked
  ircd.

====================
internationalization
====================

- We have ditched our buggy gettext support and we now use our own .lang files
  to provide translated numeric messages. See doc/messages.txt for the full
  scoop. It is now very easy to write your own (and for that see README in
  messages/.)

==================
networking support
==================

- Our IPv6 support has been fleshed out and now can coexist peacefully with
  IPv4. It is enabled by default if available and does not rely on the system
  having a working IPv6 interface.
- Cryptlinks now use Nagle's TCP_NODELAY algorithm to save overhead and are
  hence more stable. (Previously only used with ziplinks)

==============
shared modules
==============

- Previously it was not possible to change a loaded module in a running ircd
  and then proceed to unload it. Attempting to do so would crash the ircd.
  Greg Prosser has since provided a fix which has been merged into this release.

=============
ircd features
=============

- X-line (gecos ban) support has been added as module m_xline.c. X-lines are
  stored in their own configuration files, and using ircd.conf to hardcode
  X-lines is now deprecated.
- RESVs are now written into a configuration file. Using ircd.conf for these
  is now deprecated.
- Bill Jonus has written clustering support for IRC networks that wish to share
  a common list of resvs, klines, xlines, and locops.
